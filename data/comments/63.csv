That's a very... unfortunate choice of words."
1,matthieum,1484855567.0,3.0,"> Languages and technologies with the highest proportion of men compared to women include Rust, Redis, F#, and Arduino/Raspberry Pi. [ed note: Go is 4th]

Apart from Redis, those are mostly recent/esoteric/mostly for fun technologies.

Could it be that men are more likely to tinker at after work? It could also explain why men would tick more technologies, as when tinkering for fun, one is more likely to pick something ""new"" or ""interesting"" rather than the technos used day-in/day-out.

Re: Diversity in the workplace

I am sadden that yesteryear's men didn't seem to see this as important. Beyond gender, I've had the chance to work with people from varied backgrounds/cultures, and I've always found the differences of approaches led to better rounded products as each would note different issues. In my experience, the more diverse the team, the more polished the result."

4,matthieum,1484932673.0,3.0,"I am pretty sure they *can* (I certainly have a few examples on r/rust), but it seems to me that they are less prone to do so, and thus as a result are under-represented in newer technologies.

I don't know *why*, I am not even sure it is the case, it just seems like a likely explanation."

8,lamhocminh,1484920997.0,1.0,"I understand. That is the way i see most common with people too. The man always more time to enjoy and search. (I am not woman but I like)

In the article is write: 
> I don't really use stackoverflow but i take survey

with more amount of woman in this answer. This also imply less amount of women participate in survey offer useful data than show in question 1.
