Laravel is fucking great. I don't know why it's so underrated in the job market."

3,_Reasoned,1628034562.0,22.0,Weird. I'm at 125k using laravel. I have been above 100k for the last 5 years. Idk who they surveyed but it doesn't sound anything like my experience or the people I have worked with
4,ghijkgla,1628029736.0,23.0,You need to think about who is filing out the survey. Im sure $29k is a lot of money in a country like India.

6,dragon-froot,1628028226.0,3.0,"It’s easy for noobs to learn, which dilutes the market with devs who will take shit pay. It’s the best framework I have ever used, and as a threat hunter it tends to be one of the more secure frameworks out there."
7,cateyesarg,1628039998.0,3.0,"Bs, no chance a jQuery frontend job pays in average twice as laravel, this is clearly biased"
8,,1628070978.0,3.0,I make $50-$75 an hour on mainly (complex) Wordpress projects lol
9,Ok_Presentation_7599,1628078326.0,3.0,"This stat may true because even in my own country which is a third world country laravel developers are paid less than their node ruby counterparts. Most of my colleagues change their main stack from laravel to node, go, ruby and they are very happy with their pay rate. I don’t know why but most company in my country change from laravel to Java, Node or ruby or even symfony stack when they are beyond the startup time. Laravel is used in companies for startup stages. I am not bashing laravel. It is a great framework. I am just stating the fact that this stat may be true."
10,_heitoo,1628031206.0,9.0,It’s impossible to get results like this unless pooled respondents for Laravel are like Eastern Europe and India and Rails is mostly US. In reality the wages for these technologies are mostly the same.

12,acjshook,1628085944.0,2.0,"My first guess would be that it’s extremely popular lower income countries because of the excellent documentation, low entry barrier and development speed, especially with the advent of Livewire."
13,lyotox,1628092403.0,2.0,"My guess is it's because of the low entry barrier? 
You can install MAMP or whatever is being used these days and Laravel up and running in a couple minutes and if you only know basic PHP you still can make things work — the code might be horrendous, but it'll work.  

Taking Ruby (Rails), for example — you can't just install Ruby and start making an app. It's a much smaller community and you need to go through a few extra steps to start building something."
14,uriahlight,1628060946.0,1.0,Looks like a positive to me and I don't even use Laravel. It's likely a very tainted number anyways since I'm guessing a lot of the lower-paid Laravel positions come from India and Taiwan.
15,cindreta,1628064790.0,1.0,Now we know that most of the devs who answered that survey are Ruby on Rails devs who like Svelte. This is BS. Laravel is great. Anything you are really good at will get you paid well. As long as it does the job
16,proyb2,1628066989.0,1.0,"It can be about 20K USD/yr in Singapore after employee funding. The same amount as PHP developer.

It is interesting when I compare Go language is about twice the salary."
17,chilly2121,1628068623.0,1.0,"Laravel is awesome, it’s simple to use with good docs, that anyone can pick up. Therefore, with more developers swarming to Laravel due to its ease of use, supply increases, demand drops."
18,corobo,1628070352.0,1.0,"[Deeper link if you want to dig around](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-top-paying-technologies-top-paying-technologies)

I wonder if there are any biases that pull the average down. PHP being as so beloved as it is does tend to attract beginner types and of course this is stack overflow doing the survey, naturally they're going to be angled more towards the ""people who use this but need help with it"" crowd. Maybe the higher paid devs aren't on SO anymore 

I'm not saying that has happened, but it is something that could affect the outcome

Course it's also possible we need to move on to some other thing to triple our wages but I'm good where I am"

22,RandomBlokeFromMars,1629328400.0,1.0,"this is kinda BS because just yesterday i got a $80k offer from a recruiter for an EU based company who has their site made with laravel. of course i rejected it because i have my own business, but, i get offers like this, usually between $45k - $80k / year for laravel sites."
23,painkilla_,1628069364.0,-5.0,"because 50% of all larvel developers dont know anything about proper software architecture, low level php or mysql.

36,djaxial,1628079798.0,3.0,"The median in India is about $21kUSD for tech workers, so $29k would suggest the upper/senior end of the scale. It’s significantly more than the countries average, somewhere around $1k a year.

$29k is a terrible salary in tech anywhere in the “first” world so I’m doubting the validity of this survey."

40,ahinkle,1628075658.0,5.0,This is entirely incorrect and actually quite the opposite. Your post and comment history is asking the community pretty basic Laravel things. Please actually do your research before posting misinformation.
41,__radmen,1628061651.0,7.0,Wat. Symfony devs got paid almost +15k more. Drupal gets +20k more. PHP is not a problem here.

50,phoogkamer,1628065368.0,8.0,It’s easy to clarify too. It’s a bit like Wordpress (but the framework is way higher quality luckily) where it’s so popular that the bottom barrel of PHP developers are using Laravel too (and they get paid less). I get paid the same whether our team decides to use Laravel PHP or Golang or Brainfuck and for most of the more senior devs that will probably be similar.
51,MrSaidOutBitch,1628065460.0,8.0,Laravel has more market share. This means more underpaid entry level positions use it. That's my guess.

67,phoogkamer,1628065192.0,6.0,"This is just you jumping on the bandwagon honestly. That article was barely relevant when it was written and it’s completely irrelevant now. For most web application (backends) or APIs PHP is at least equally optimal compared to Python or Ruby (generally faster and better really). If you need async it might be easier to use JS (though you have some options in PHP there too).

PHP is (no longer) terrible. There is no reason to say otherwise nowadays and referencing such an old and at the time already biased article doesn’t change that.

However, not using PHP is also fine. It’s not way better than the alternatives. Generally you should use what you know for business and what you want to learn for learning. People really need to cut the crap shitting on PHP though."

72,hafssolpt,1628073715.0,1.0,"I can relate to this...

Here in Portugal we see a lot of Laravel development agencies, but generally they use for small projects (corporate websites, small webstores).

Big web projects (and i can only talk about PHP) tend to use other frameworks that are more ""stable"" or with a release cycle more slow, like symfony. Other cases are like webshops, if it is in PHP and it's big they use Magento, if it's small they use woocommerce.

The thing about hight rates in other frameworks is related with offer, there are plenty of laravel developers (it's good, so it's easy) but few want to keep up with drupal or symfony projects, so the rates are higher.
Also, most drupal and symfony projects are legacy and the are few developers that want to do that, so the rates go up..."
