... I guess it checks out. Those are the languages I have in some form or fashion used through my career. I know a lot more but they either aren't ones I've had to write professionally in or learned on the side for fun.

I would guess that it's mainly due to there being a handful of popular languages and if you know say Java, you likely won't jump to a similar language like .NET you'd get another Java job. Looking at my list there's a pretty big spread of use cases."

For example if you count HTML as a language and you use JavaScript and c sharp and SQL....  you didn't choose to use four languages you're just a web developer... and maybe you add python to that mix but it's not because you chose python that's because your company has a search service in Google cloud and you need to maintain it.

Believe me, if I had a choice I would write c sharp for everything 100% percent of the time.  I would never choose to touch anything else.

Currently 28 years old, worked 2 years with COBOL in the banking sector. Wanted to kill myself, not because it is hard, but because it is a mess. The big companies and their ""home made framework"" respecting 0 good practices. Reunions to decide whether or not it is needed to increase the memory of a server by 10mb. This shit filling with spaces crap because if you declare a variable requiring 10 characters (PIC X(10)) and you have ""foo"", you need to fill it with 7 spaces or it fucks up everything. That create unexpected problems because you need to fill and trim everything. COBOL is quite simple imo, still the apanage of corporate bullshit. Use old COBOL, Java, C. Files with 15k lines. Can't use a modern editor because no one gives a shit about cobol and it's ""bad for security anyway"". Fucking rewrite that shit already, but you can't justify it to investors. ""It works"". They gotta stop recruit mathematicians,  physics doctors, chemists,  biologists, big diploma guys that don't know shits about IT and/or programming and use outdated shits. Yeah I fucking left because your technologies are bad.

Sometimes, yes. For example, virtually all web browsers run JavaScript and only JavaScript, so if you're pushing code to web browsers you either have to write in JavaScript directly, or in some language that you can transform into (reasonably efficient) JavaScript.

Most of the time, though, you can use any of a large number of languages. You have to decide which to use based off of several factors, including but not limited to:

* what sort of environment you'll be running in,
* how fast the code needs to run in that environment,
* what sort of software libraries or frameworks relevant to your task exist for that language,
* what languages you (and/or your lead programmers) already know (and/or are interested in learning),
* how difficult it will be to hire _new_ developers for that language,

and so forth. Sometimes there will be a single obvious ""best"" language — but, mostly, there won't, and tradeoffs will need to be made."

Everything is in frameworks now (and it went through a LOT of turmoil in the earlier 2010s) but the forerunners are now react, angular 2, and vue.

Honestly after dabbling around I would go with react and plain javascript. Typescript is nice (has type safety and stuff, transpiles to js) but honestly I would just stick to JS unless TS significantly overtakes it.

React/redux is kind of an inversion on how you would expect data to flow but it's small and simple overall, and favors composition. You can get started pretty easy with their bootstrap project (it lets you eject to regular react if you want)

There's a few new things in modern JS that made life a bit easier like arrow functions that make more concise syntax

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions

It's an emcascript6 feature. You can bring these in (despite what browsers support) in your project requirements, and it will transpile down to normalized JS. You can see all the new EM6 features here

http://es6-features.org/

But being good at front end JS generally means knowing how to pull anything you want out of the DOM, and put it anywhere you want, talk to the server, and control user flow efficiently and with good practices, and to do that you need actual use cases.

You don't learn new technologies on the job, only on the side if you're brave, and when you try to leave to do something new (new or recent technologies), well your experience is worth nothing. Congrats motherfucker you used outdated technologies. Either you continue that way. Or you take a pay cut (or like I did switching jobs and losing a bit of salary, but negligible). So you would've get more by learning new technologies, then switching for a higher paying job in my opinion. But if you're fine working with outdated technologies and doing corporate wanking, go on. It's just the experience doesn't have much value on the market, except banking. But if they switch to new technologies, it can happen I believe in it, they will most likely take new employees confortable with those technologies.

Edit : Also regarding the salaries, it was maybe true 10-20 years ago, since the crisis and all, junior salaries went down (at least in the company where I was). So I don't think this is true anymore."
199,Wiwwil,1566366565.0,1.0,"Kind of. There's much to be gained by using modern frameworks. Heck they are free now. Readability, security, organization, mvc, updates, testing. I firmly believe by switching to modern framework they will even gain money faster than they think because there will be less maintenance, fastest new features, no need to maintain lots tasks anymore that will be handled by the framework. I don't think they will lose much in terms of performance either.

It's like you take an old project in PHP. It's the anarchy, nothing is organized. But since it is the banking and the COBOL, it is ok. You don't rewrite it you just tweak it."
200,Wiwwil,1566365983.0,1.0,"Why then was it not a good fit ? You need 5 times the time to do the same work while using a modern framework. Algorithms aren't hard either 90% of the time. I'm pretty sure if you start from scratch with a modern framework it'll be much easier. Probably lots of repeated tasks, things never updated, others no one know how it really works. Stop using those flat files. Bits of code never used because there was no testing but functional. At some point they will have to. I'm pretty sure it'll take 5 years to rewrite the majority with a modern framework, also you gain lots of security, readability, modernity. I don't think you will lose that much in performance."
201,Zerlon,1566397510.0,1.0,"We’re talking +- 43%. The average salary of my friends with the same amt of experience in other languages * 1,43 gives my salary. However over time as I get more experienced the gap will increase even further. With my salary bumping up every year vs my friends who will see an increase bi or tri-yearly of a considerably lower amt). The as400 developer demand is huge because all banks, hospitals and most big firms still use mainframe/as400 and schools, unies are no longer bringing new devs to the market. For a bank it is much safer and more profitable to overpay an as400 developer than it would ever be changing to a new system. Also security wise the as400 knows no competitors. Even microsoft uses mainframe because windows servers can’t handle their huge amt of data. Ofcourse Everything I’m saying is in my country and thus very very variable. In my country there is a relatively small loan gap compared to others. So results may be very different in your area. I live in Belgium btw. Also the 43% is calculated based on 5 friend’s salaries and the salaries were compared BEFORE taxes. The net difference is far smaller since Belgium works with tax brackets."

Those arrow functions seem interesting! 

I've worked with the asynchronous side of things, I'd made my own portable AJAX framework as a little project, though I'd lie if I said I understand exactly what it means (the jargon for sync vs. async flies over my head).

Definitely though keeping it restricted to just front-end as it isn't a language I'm a giant fan of (though I don't hate it, unlike PHP, which I just cannot even).

RN I've taken a break from web stuff, actually been looking at python tkinter for UI programs atm, which is an interesting task.

Who knows, it could come up at work and help you stand out and get a boost in pay or a promotion)

Non-work related - I run a short term rental out of my house (Airbnb) and I've used Python to automate emails to my guests (the program checks the calendar, and a few days before check-in it sends a personalized email)

Python is pretty versatile and easy to set up to run at intervals on your computer. You could automate pretty much any repetitive task

VBA - I've used for various Excel programs, both work and not work related. Personally I've used it for budget calculations (regular budget stuff you can do without VBA, mine was more of an investment calculator and I wanted to add some fancy buttons)

This means if you need to make a call out the whole UI won't freeze until it's done, you have to be careful doing so so you don't dirty your state, usually whatever component is involved in the async call you have a way to show that that element is pending. Like if it's a button, you would put a loading icon over it until it finishes.

There's a variety of domains where it dominates and others where it has been encroaching on territory that used to belong to other languages, mostly due to numerous top notch open source projects. The ecosystem in general is exceptionally strong, and pretty much every time I have to dive into another language I'm reminded of that... the documentation, quality of various online guides, communities, etc... things are simply done well, but with an eye towards pragmatism that sets it apart from a variety of more academically ""pure"" languages. The language also evolves significantly faster than most, which allows it to shamelessly copy good ideas from others.

10 years ago it was just barely starting to be used in classrooms, but nowadays it's the most popular language in that realm. There are definitely more powerful, performant, and scalable languages, but in terms of bang for your buck Python is straightforward to learn and you can do the vast majority of things with it. Because of all of this, [Python has mostly obsoleted its main competitors](https://i.imgur.com/TB2JBLX.png): Perl and PHP are well out of the picture, while Ruby is solid but small and trending down- I think this is because it's very tightly coupled with Rails and/or configuration management and so if you're not in one of those camps a lot of support just isn't there for you.

Other languages that I expect at the forefront of the next decade are Rust, Kotlin, and Typescript. They have similar expressiveness to Python while catering to additional needs that are prevalent across domains. And most importantly, they're fun to write in. Languages that are shitty to write in don't develop the open source tooling and community necessary for widespread success."
293,slipshoddread,1566404390.0,1.0,"C and C++ have a lot of things going on that require knowledge of low level computer science principles including direct memory management. These are not common amongst high level languages and require a deeper understanding of what is going on. They also share the feature of having incredibly complex syntax, to complement their capabilities.

Once you understand these languages, pretty much any other language is just learning syntax/formatting rules, especially languages that share the C style syntax such as Java. As an example Java runs on a vm, so things like memory management dont exist from a programmer perspective, reducing the requirements to learn it. If you already know the principles and dont have to do half the things you normally would, youll find it easy to learn.

326,cleantushy,1566390998.0,1.0,"Yeah! There's 2 common ways to do it (that I've seen)

The first is a purely python solution. Add a ""timer"" to your code. You manually start the program and then it's running all day every day on your computer. The timer or scheduler ""waits"" for the time you want, and runs the code

The issue here is if your computer restarts, you have to make sure you run the code again.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15088037/python-script-to-do-something-at-the-same-time-every-day

(I would go with the answer by user2099484, using the schedule library, rather than the accepted one)

The other way is to use some other program that can schedule tasks. On Windows, I've found Windows task scheduler to be easiest. You just need to know the location of your python install, and the location of the file you want to run. As long as your computer is on, it will run, and it will stay scheduled if your computer restarts.

https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/product/analytics/scheduling-a-python-script-or-model-to-run-at-a-prescribed-time/

You can also use cron on either windows or Linux

https://prateekvjoshi.com/2014/04/19/how-to-schedule-tasks-on-linux/

I'd recommend installing the python library python-crontab because the syntax is familiar and easy

As an almost-native C++ dev, it's not the C++-dev half of that that I don't understand; it's the Pythonista half. I understand why Pythonistas would have a hard time learning Java or C++; what surprised me was that Python-only devs also have a harder time learning languages like JavaScript or Ruby or `bash` scripting, where those shouldn't be significant issues.

>  (more than aware it isnt given its neural net etc capabilites)

In an important sense, though, those aren't really Python's capabilities. Those are C's capabilities, with the Python acting as glue code.

I'm not knocking it for that; that's an important job. But it's worth being aware that it's not something one could do in pure Python — or, at least, that it's something Python is too slow to be useful for.

> They also share the feature of having incredibly complex syntax, to complement their capabilities.

This is misleading, I think. The complexity of C++ syntax is in large part an accident of history: a brand-new language with all the capabilities of C++, but lacking any backwards-compatibility requirements, would almost certainly be significantly syntactically simpler."

Oh, one more way to schedule python I should mention. If you don't want your computer on 24/7, and your code doesn't need access to anything on your computer (or you can move those files to the cloud) you can use pythonanywhere.

You can create a free account. It's limited CPU time but it should be enough to run a scheduled script each day (and you get your own website as well if you want to play with using python for web development). If you need an upgrade it's only $5 per month. It's worth it, in my opinion. I have a web dev account ($12/mo)

You can schedule your python tasks on their servers, so you don't have to worry about your computer restarting or turning off. And it can read/edit any files you upload, or create new ones

As for your second question, there are xls reader/writer libraries in python which should be able to edit your files directly without exporting to csv. You'll still have to close Excel, run the program, and then open Excel to see the results, but it should maintain your Excel calcs

http://www.python-excel.org/

(Basically anything you need to do in python - there's a library for it)

Your other option is to commit to either Excel or Python 

If you don't need to use python and just need a program that can do additional calculations on your Excel data that can't be done with formulas, you can replace your python script with VBA. You can create it from within Excel. If you haven't used it before I know it sounds like a pain to learn a whole new programming language, but once you get the syntax, the logic is the same.

You can even use a VB script to schedule it to open your Excel, and run the macro at a specific time (scheduled similarly to scheduling python)

If you prefer to stick with python, you can trash the Excel calcs altogether. You're already using pandas, so import numpy, and anything you can do in Excel, you can do in python. Even the little things

I particularly related to [this SO answer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/241104/programming-language-vs-markup-language-vs-scripting-language/297679#297679) on the matter. I suspect it's not the most upvoted because it doesn't attempt to draw clear lines between them, rather accepting that it's not some clean separation. Scripting languages and markup languages are simply some rough subsets of programming language (and thus are also programming languages in themselves). Ditto for [this answer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/241104/programming-language-vs-markup-language-vs-scripting-language/297685#297685) too on the same question."

No offense but you just seem starstruck by node, it's not the lord and savior of languages. It has a lot of web specific libraries because of the web side, those are irrelevant once you hit backend. Node isn't any better at serving as an api endpoint than any other language and if you are looking at performance something like echo will obliterate it. Python can do anything node can do as a server too."

393,chmod--777,1566372529.0,3.0,"In all seriousness, there is a good one IIRC. The only problem with vim plugins for other IDEs is they are never close to feature complete. You get the main navigation controls but you miss out usually on the substitution commands, good vim plugins, macros...

With the right plugins vim is easily an IDE, but it's more like a piece of your IDE. My IDE is tmux, with one pane with vim code, another with an ipython shell, another with pdb/pudb, another one using ag silver searcher, maybe sed, etc. You even have refactoring tools in vim with the right plugin, can bring up docs, navigate to definition, etc. The main thing is it's just not usually a whole comprehensive package like an IDE, but a set of tools you use together. I've been developing python professionally for a decade, and stuck with vim and tmux and commandline tools, and everything works extremely well. You just end up writing bash functions and aliases and git shortcuts and write python tools to help you write code. The commandline opens up a ton of options, no limits really.

I just like having quick keystrokes to do what I want, and it might be tedious as all hell to learn at first but eventually you get super quick and the whole system works great together. I never suggest vim as an ide to people learning and starting professionally coding, but if they express interest I show them how to get started and what tools will make it work."

'clever' coders are the worst,  I've had to deal with too much shitty code from them in my time and their clever (spaghetti/obfuscated) code.

Recently I worked with a bunch of new coders and the thing they always liked about my code was the comments/examples - sadly they did not often seem to realise this was what they should be doing too, but they slowly learnt.

It's a small downside compared to the huge upsides of using other people's packages."
