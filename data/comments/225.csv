 - **Support** - Most open source projects support Linux first. A couple examples are Golangs new [plugin](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/) feature and mozillas [servo](https://download.servo.org/) engine.

 - **No adware or spyware, anti-hostageware** - pretty obvious

 - **works on more hardware than Mac OS**, so you're not stuck with their bad decisions (and setting up a hackintosh is more involved than installing most modern linux distros)

 - **Containerization** - You can run your whole dev environment inside a portable container that will work on basically any GNU/Linux OS. You can run multiple dev environments side by side with multiple containers.

Now it highly depends on your definition of ""important"" but if you want a *regular* dev job just fuck uni (especially if you have to pay huge sums for it). You will learn much cheaper and more relevant stuff on your own. Also don't forget that ""people skills"" are often also very important and that's not something they really teach you in a CS course (some touch some aspects of it, but it's probably not enough).

Xamarin leaks pretty hard in terms of being an abstraction.  I remember getting strange crashes when presenting UIViewControllers modally.  Which is a very basic and common bit of UI functionality in iOS.  This crash would only crash on the device and not in the simulator.  Enough to drive someone insane.  There would also be strange bugs related to how objective-c is more of a dynamic language vs mono C# which is more static.

During that job, I convinced management to let me re-write the apps in pure Android/iOS (Java/Swift).  Which made me much more productive thanks to the much more mature development environments.  For example, Android Studio is pretty good at telling you which function calls are deprecated for the target Android version.  When I used Xamarin, Visual Studio was not as useful.  The challenge of mobile development is really learning the frameworks (Android and Cocoa Touch), which you have to do anyway with native development.

In the situation I was in, the only real benefit of Xamarin was using C#, but Java and Swift are similar enough where I didn't have much issues just porting code.  Keep in mind, I stopped using Xamarin right before Microsoft bought them.  So, as usual, your mileage may vary."

You might think being Unix like would mean you have access to lots of tools, but you don't. You get Mac specific variants and the vast majority of developer libraries and tools don't actual have Mac ports.

That and the rest of the OS is just a complete exercise in frustration. Want a mouse that is actually ergonomic? Use it, but you'll have to work with painful scroll acceleration unless you buy tools or dive in to hidden, undocumented configuration files.

Want to see hidden files? Used to be an option, but that was taken away in favor of an obscure hotkey.

Uninstalling should be easy, but it isn't because shit litters your system in a complete free for all and isn't taken with uninstalls. At least when this happens on windows, you normally have an idea of where to look. 

The update system just straight up doesn't work. If the system goes to sleep in the middle of a large download, it has to start over every time for me. That's a pain in the ass cause I have 100 meg internet but Mac update servers are run by molasses covered potatoes and take 5 hours to deliver a 100 meg update. Never mind that it likes to forget what you have installed all the time and so claims you're up to date when you actually aren't.

Mac used to be pretty decent, but these days it is bug filled shit that fights with power users at every single turn.

Never mind that Apple themselves haven't updated their powerful lines in years and so are perceived to be abandoning developers. The latest Macbook wasn't well received by developers.

You likely haven't used a piece of software written in Smalltalk, because in most cases you would then be inside the Smalltalk environment itself. Unlike other languages, most Smalltalk implementations are a live environment that you are manipulating as you go. It's a very different way to program and can take some getting used to when you first try it. Check out some Alan Kay videos on YouTube to get an idea of the philosophy behind it.
  
As for web development, stick with what everyone else is doing. There is a framework for creating web applications in ST (called [Seaside](http://seaside.st/)) but I don't use it (also a web developer here).
  
However, I think if someone can get a ST VM up and running in WebAssembly, and when wasm can finally manipulate the DOM, we could have a true live system in every browser. It could also make front-end development much better, as well as the web applications themselves. Things like [Amber Smalltalk](http://www.amber-lang.net/) were a good start, but WebAssembly really steps up the possibilities in my opinion."

The typical customer of IBM's Smalltalk was a larger corporate customer of IBM's that had internal development teams that were open to trying less-conventional development environments with the hope to reap big benefits. A high-profile example that seems typical was [Chrysler's C3 project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Comprehensive_Compensation_System), although I don't know which vendor's Smalltalk they used.

- easier to build packages (you create a PKGFILE and run makepkg to create a custom package; takes maybe 10 minutes)
- fewer packages for the same amount of software (don't need -dev, -doc, etc)
- it doesn't automatically start services for you (I prefer to configure before I start services like databases, desktop environments, etc)
