2,ninjanerd032,1652660857.0,2.0,Stack overflow is built on pedantic people.
3,Possible-Eche,1652667656.0,0.0,This guy keeps mining this subreddit for tiktok views. Almost as bad as some onlyfans models…

7,mr_hard_name,1652688015.0,1.0,"You can’t post an answer on stackoverflow if your score is too low, so you would need a lot of good answers on your alt account"
8,PappaOC,1652703984.0,1.0,Nothing triggers people more than presenting a wrong answer confidently!
9,Heequwella,1653332438.0,2.0,"I remember a cartoon about getting support on Linux forums. The guy asked for help with a printer driver, HP laserjet 4 on Redhat Linux (for example) and got nothing but replies giving him criticism for not using debian or not using a different printer or whatever. 

So then he posts something like ""going back to windows. Linux sucks, it can't even print"" and there were tons of helpful replies asking if he had tried x or y and so on.

I want to say it was an xkcd cartoon, but I can't find it by searching. Maybe it was just a story someone told once. 

Anyway, it's the same approach I take with tech support now. I call to cancel my account and they escalate me to the good tier of tech support."
10,emily747,1652672556.0,3.0,"There's so much to unpack here... Firstly, what's wrong with being an onlyfans model? Secondly, this is a social media platform, and you're on a community that's dedicated to programming humor, and now you're angry at someone for posting programming humor. So what if they're reposting THEIR content from different platforms? 

No one is benefiting from you complaining here."
11,CodeWithAhsan,1652667774.0,2.0,Would you prefer if the videos didn’t have the tiktok watermark? Because I can think of people still crying about stuff they didn’t before.
12,DmMacniel,1652684204.0,2.0,And noone is benefiting from you bitching about their complaint.
13,Possible-Eche,1652667891.0,5.0,No I’d prefer to simply not see your unfunny posts clogging up this subreddits newsfeed.
14,emily747,1652684427.0,2.0,Ok so I feel as though we’re going into an infinite recursive sequence so I’m just going to stop this stack overflow error of Tu Quoque here…
15,CodeWithAhsan,1652667990.0,1.0,Do you know why you see them? Probably because people upvote them? And also probably because I don’t really care what you prefer. Lol. Keep at it.
16,TimTam55,1652669204.0,2.0,">ably because people upvote them? And also probably because I don’t really care what you prefer.
