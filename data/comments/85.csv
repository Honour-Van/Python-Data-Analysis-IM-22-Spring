3,thethrowaccount21,1554899960.0,90.0,"Linux is a dream for development. When you're a developer, in fact, one of the only good criticisms in the past about Linux becomes its strongest quality: the reliance on the terminal! Unlike windows which makes you lose several seconds by clicking on and opening a gui for everything (trust me, it adds up), with linux you have direct access to everything you need right from the terminal. 

This makes a developers workflow much, much faster. SSH'ing into a server to replace an executable and coming right back takes a couple seconds, limited by your typing speed. Opening remote connect, clicking on all the settings you need, clicking ok, then clicking on this and that to copy it over, rdpclip.exe freezing and needing to be restarted which is more clicks, it definitely adds up."

Been really happy with the move so far.   I also get Android which was not the reason for doing the switch but it actually comes in handy more often than I thought it would.

Really like how Google has done the GNU/Linux support on the Pixel Books with Crostini.     How they did it you get Wayland and XWindows support.

I have move to using Flutter for iOS development and the only thing that still sucks is needing to turn on my MBP to sign apps for the Apple app store.  The last thing I need is a cloud based service that I can use to sign Apple apps.

BTW, the keyboard broke on the MBP a second time and what was the catalyst.    Apple support was excellent.  I could not ask for more.  But it is still a huge hassle to go to the Apple store and be without the machine.

The keyboard issue on the MBP is not getting as much press as it should.   It is an actual issue.  Not a bunch of reddiots bitching."

21,supermans_90s_mullet,1554986631.0,1.0,"Linux is not a ""platform"" and things should stop acting like it is.

There is no real feasible way for software to ""target Linux"" and no ""GNU/Linux"" is not a plarform either.

Most of these distributions are their own platform and software often needs significant patching to run  on another and that's fine; these different operating systems have no obligation to be like one another but things should stop acting like it's any other way as well.

I would go so far as to say that for a lot of use cases  ""Ubuntu GNOME"" and ""Ubuntu KDE"" already become different platforms because some stuff stops working properly. Steam in particular says ""We only support Ubuntu Xorg KDE/GNOME/Unity"" and other than that you're on your own.""; one some platforms that are similar enough you can get it to work with hacks but good luck ever running it on Alpine Xorg KDE or Ubuntu Wayland Sway.

Linux just isn't a ""platform"" in the same way that Windows is where all this is centrally controlled and for a lot of applications whether you use Wayland or Xorg will have a bigger impact than kernels like say Wine which runs fine on any Unixlike kernel but the developers have announced they have no intention of as much as attempting a Wayland port since it doesn't offer a lot of things they need and it's far harder to map Windows to it because it functions completely differently from Windows."

* multi-screen with different DPIs or different resolutions. Honestly multi-screen in general. Windows has that pretty locked down. Well except for OSX. OSX is by far the best environment I've seen in regards to dealing with weird resolutions or DPI scaling.
* laptops. Just laptops in general. 2-in-1s are basically useless on linux, their tablet functionality is hit or miss on a good day.
* dock compatibility. USB 3.1 type c docks, especially using MST, seem to be 50-50 on whether it will actually work.
* battery life. I haven't done a good benchmark recently, but power saving seems to be skewed to windows. This is generally due to the attention manufacturers pay to windows drivers vs linux drivers.

Don't get me wrong, I mean 90% of my time is spent in a ssh terminal. I love docker, I love oVirt, I run homelab services on proxmox. But user experience in a notebook environment is not a strong suit for linux.

EDIT: Also, I *love* powershell. Powershell is awesome. I've started recoding my shell scripts into powershell core, because awk/sed/data structure handling in linux is so ugly. I love doing text replacement or JSON structuring in powershell. In bash, it feels like I'm fighting the OS.

71,Soundtoxin,1554955631.0,2.0,I think someone using it has more meaning behind it. It doesn't come on most computers. In many cases you have to install it yourself. A lot of Windows users don't even know what an operating system is.
72,audioen,1554953095.0,3.0,"Yeah, I am perhaps mildly exceptional in that have written code on all platforms, largely java and javascript kind of stuff in a so-called full stack setting. VS Code, Eclipse, node and openjdk are of course perfectly installable on all OSes, so you can evaluate the operating systems against each other while running the same client software. Hardware is typically different, though.

In my experience, Windows is hampered by low performance of its file I/O, and this is true even after you disable things like antivirus and windows search from indexing your node\_modules directories. It is bad enough that Windows seems to be several times slower doing some task that involves a lot of small file I/O, though this depends on the hardware as well. I guess WSL suffers from similar problem, I've seen that it is noticeably slower than native Linux doing similar tasks should be. I also ran into some compatibility issues, such as that deeply nested directories may end up hitting Windows's 256 character pathname length limitation, though this is only a concern for some older, legacy APIs. Still, that's not much consolation when the particular program you need doesn't work.

Linux, in comparison, has excellent i/o performance but I find that its GUIs are clearly laggier than the competition's. The new GNOME that's going into 19.04 seems to have made at least GNOME feel a lot snappier, but I think it's still not quite as fast as it should be. In my subjective experience Linux applications are just slower to paint and to respond to window resize and stuff like that, and it's been like that since I first started using Linux sometime in 199x. I think I had best experience on nvidia proprietary driver sometime in like 2004 before compositors arrived running KDE 3.5. Adding compositor to X made all GUIs noticeably laggier, giving Linux that heavy, nonresponsive feel that it seems to have never recovered from, over a decade later. I always complain about this but nobody else seems to agree, though.

So, in the end, I have stuck with macOS for now. It is the operating system married to hardware that I have least annoyance with, but Apple is getting worse. To be honest, I'm kinda dreading the next upgrade because I have a feeling that Apple computers have already reached the end of their road, for me. There seems to be problems all around from software to firmware to hardware, and they didn't use to have these issues until fairly recently, say in the last 3 years. I now have random issues with bluetooth connectivity which only clear via a reboot, the keyboard insensitivity issues we have been having from 2017 and forwards, and random crashes of system software and GPU lockups once a month or so. The previous 2016 MacBook Pro I had ate two batteries in about two years, both got destroyed way before their expected time, and I've no idea what is wrong with that particular computer that it would do that.

It's a real shame, this brand used to be pretty good. I had years of problem-free experience in the beginning, but perhaps it was Jobs's influence and demand for perfection from when he was still alive, or I was just lucky. I guess my next machine is going to be Linux one, and I may have to get one that has 120 Hz high-dpi wide-gamut screen, or something like that if such a machine even exists."
73,PullJosh,1554925621.0,5.0,">Do people seriously think that developers would pick Windows if they had other options? 

Not sure if you're looking for honest answers or if it was more of a rhetorical thing, but I personally switched back to Windows (from Linux) because I found Linux to be too unstable (weird bugs with connecting/disconnecting monitors, funky hardware behavior in general, etc...)

I loved Linux when it worked, but Windows has been far more consistent for me in the long run. I still love the Linux philosophy, but just couldn't stick with it because it wasn't user-friendly enough for an (already often-confused) developer like myself.

Laptops are messy under Linux if you are not willing to put some effort into configuring the OS, but that's only for one God damn reason that has nothing to do with Linux... Windows comes pre-installed on almost every machine you can buy. That's a huge problem imo.

Also when people lack some support from the most used distributions, it mostly (I'm saying that by experience) boils down to the distro not being up to date with the most recent hardware. Honestly, try installing and Arch on recent hardware that's barely used. Yes it is hard and requires some knowledge and tweaking compared to a good old T420, but you can get so much more out of it that you would on Windows, at the expense of loosing some mild features (some RGB keyboards, fine grained fan control).

Blessing/curse of Linux is that it supports what the people developing it want to use. This is why Linux will flawlessly support Thinkpads and obscure gaming peripherals and have no support for flagship Asus/Microsoft/etc products with novelty features that geeks aren't familiar with or interested in.

>I love powershell. Powershell is awesome. I've started recoding my shell scripts into powershell core, because awk/sed/data structure handling in linux is so ugly. I love doing text replacement or JSON structuring in powershell. In bash, it feels like I'm fighting the OS.

This is a pet complaint of mine, but this comparison is the wrong one to make.

Powershell is not analogous to Bash; It is analogous to Python. That's why it's got so many features, such rich data handling, and more verbose error messages than a nested C++ template. It is glaringly apparent from every design choice that Powershell was never intended for continuous, interactive human use; The ergonomics are terrible. Like Python, you can technically use it as a REPL, and maybe a ""shell"", but that's not the intended use of either.

Powershell is indeed a better system automation/data management language than Bash; Then again, so is almost any real programming language, most of which Linux already had first and best.

Bash is a user interface that happens to support automation, in the same way Microsoft Word supports macros. It may be technically possible to manage complex data state in Word macros but it's hardly a fair fight.

The ""Windows version"" of Bash is *nothing*; Windows has no first-class user-interactive terminal environment. Bash et al were the primary or only user environment for Unix systems for many years; This is why they're so darn comfy -- it's been refined to perfection to be what it is. After years of having no analogous power-user interface, Microsoft missed the point and named their automation tool ""Powershell"" implying that the point of a command line was to write scripts, as if the reason Unix people have opening a shell down to muscle memory was because they're constantly needing to touch-up their scripts at a moment's notice. It's not, go to /r/unixporn and watch the workflow fetishists play with their terminals and appreciate people experiencing joy interacting with a computer. Windows still has nothing like this and that's why it's an agonizing experience to use."

I have never found bash scripting anything remotely adjacent to ""intuitive"". It's completely unreadable unless you're a programmer and it was a huge part of why systemd  ended up so popular. A user shouldn't have to know how to wrangle a cryptic scripting language just to make a process start as a daemon at boot. All of the other major popular options used bash scripting for that. Maybe if you've used bash for years it makes sense, but if you compare to pretty much any other scripting language it's an absolute unreadable mess. Javascript is more readable than bash. bash looks like someone really felt the need to save 200 bytes in a 20-line script which may have made sense in the 80s but today we have the RAM and storage for something more comfortably readable. I avoid bash like the plague. If I have to do any complex scripting I go for Python and my primary shell is fish. Switching to fish was a major improvement in quality of life for me when I discovered it. Just realizing that I don't really have to touch bash scripts beyond skimming other people's script from time to time made Linux a much more accessible option for me. I probably wouldn't be here today if OpenRC was still the norm.

Powershell has its issues, but it's much more readable and pleasant than bash. As mentioned above, working with JSON and other data structures is *so* much more intuitive since Powershell includes custom objects. In makes data output so much easier and more reliable.

Nothing illegal about what Microsoft is doing, as you originally stated. Hardware companies don't bundle with Linux because Linux isn't a single OS anyways, and anyone who wants Linux will likely reinstall with a different distro.

The original issue wasn't even market saturation, it was hardware support. Who cares if pre-build desktops are running windows, the issue was after you wipe it clean and install Linux the hardware support isn't as good as Windows. That has nothing to do with finding Linux in stores or not. Any hardware company has the choice of shipping with Linux if they want to, and they typically do not. Windows currently has an advantage here no matter how much we would like it to be otherwise.
