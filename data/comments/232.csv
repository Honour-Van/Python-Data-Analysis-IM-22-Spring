7,FLINDINGUS,1650855400.0,1.0,About 5 years ago I was working on a project that would always cause the Visual Studio editor to hang.  You also couldn't kill the process.  You had to reboot your PC.  I found a mention of the issue in a ticket submitted to microsoft with no resolution.  Needless to say I ported that project over to a different toolchain.
