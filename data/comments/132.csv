1,Reeferchief,1627945542.0,49.0,"Let's go, loving 0.5! I started my vim journey about two years ago, so happy I made the switch from Vscode."
2,SeniorMars,1627947068.0,12.0,"Hmmm. I find atom being a dreaded editor being really interesting. I have some friends who use it, and I thought it was well received and a really customizable editor. Any idea why it's so low?"
3,Maskdask,1627942847.0,11.0,Are there any statistics about the most used text editors? I couldn't find any.
4,Pocco81,1627958937.0,6.0,Congrats Nvim team!!

8,realvikas,1627983221.0,-1.0,"We'll all know, even without this survey, that *neovim is the best editor*.


On a side note, this whole survey looks stupid to me."
9,Aggravating-Pick9389,1627967966.0,10.0,Same here... I can't imagine using something else
10,war_against_myself,1627950879.0,14.0,"Atom was the first editor I used after Notepad++ for a very long time. It’s a great editor. Unfortunately, it’s very slow. It’s electron based and it doesn’t feel very streamlined or optimized. That’s the gripe I get the most. It is very customizable. I still have a soft spot for it, and I still open it for Atom beautify which is the best comprehensive plug-in I’ve found on any editor anywhere that formats code of nearly any type. Or when I need to work with an FTP on a remote system as Atom is the only editor I’ve found that has a really nice remote file system tree where I can edit files remotely via FTP like they exist on my own system. 


I have a soft spot for it because it was the first thing I ever used that had IDE-like function, autocomplete, etc. I was more productive in vscode, and debugging was easier, but my tmux/vim workflow is just faster and more organized than any GUI app will ever be, so I’ve abandoned them all except for very occasional edge cases I haven’t put time and energy into replicating in vim."
11,Maskdask,1627973230.0,7.0,"GitHub develops Atom, and Microsoft bought GitHub. Since Microsoft develops VSCode I've heard some concerns that Atom will get depricated. Perhaps that explains why Atom is the most dreaded?"

15,BrasilArrombado,1628021648.0,1.0,You don't always marry the girl that you love...
16,amrock__,1627989115.0,3.0,It's outdated I guess
17,project2501,1628005286.0,3.0,"Could be that the work you do if you use netbeans is work you don't want to do.

""I hate using the hammer because my job is hitting my own hand"" doesn't make the hammer bad but fuck if I won't hate hammers pretty quickly."
18,BrasilArrombado,1628024622.0,1.0,"Because the user interface sucks.  
1) theme/zoom breaks depending on the JVM used  
2) there's no builtin dark theme and the plugins for it are really bad.
3) indentation messes up randomly
4) Intellij Idea Ultimate is much better in pretty much any aspect."
19,shaunsingh0207,1628046991.0,1.0,I've never seen anyone who preffered Netbeans over IntelliJ or even Eclipse given the option
20,Reeferchief,1627974810.0,6.0,"I know right, using a mouse?? Why would I ever do such a thing."
21,VaginalMatrix,1627966882.0,11.0,God I just want an editor like Atom which is not a browser.
22,war_against_myself,1627950047.0,23.0,"Interesting I wonder how many people would answer vim even though they are using neovim....

I usually don’t specify unless I’m talking to someone who’s eyes won’t gloss over immediately lol"
23,SeoCamo,1627972975.0,17.0,And you can't always love what you use
24,BearyGoosey,1627992421.0,2.0,"Yep. I'm a Linux sysadmin that has to use windows on my work laptop. I would give quite a lot to just be able to use a Linux system natively, but such is the corporate world (mostly anyway)"
25,RishiKMR,1627996981.0,1.0,"Ya it is, but personally never been in a situation like that!"
26,war_against_myself,1627992234.0,4.0,YES.
27,videogame_retrograde,1627955457.0,13.0,Unless I get asked more questions I usually say Vim. I have a couple times caught and corrected myself to Neovim.

29,RishiKMR,1627997212.0,2.0,'Never been in a situation like that' - because I just graduated.. & I understand that's why.. 😅😂
