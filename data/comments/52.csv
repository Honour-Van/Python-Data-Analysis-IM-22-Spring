When you're done, please comment again with `done`. Your flair will be updated to reflect the number of posts you've transcribed and the post will be marked as completed.

Here's [a checklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/checklist) that might help you out -- not just for newbies!

This is a(n) image post, so please use the following formatting:

---

**Note:** To use these format guides, all you have to do is copy and paste everything within the blue markdown box and replace the prompts with the relevant information. The two asterisks turn any text between them into boldtext, and the three hyphens in a row when separated by a blank row above and below will become a horizontal rule. 

**Remember:** We want to transcribe the text directly, please do not make corrections to typos or grammatical errors, but feel free to use [sic] to indicate that the text is exactly as in the original. Please copy and paste any emojis into your transcription.
