A colleague told me about Rust back in 2017, but I basically shrugged it off because I was already content with the languages I was using. In 2020 I had work hiatus and decided to look into Rust, just for fun. Safe to say I fell in love with it.

Some of the things I like about Rust : 

1. the ergonomics (method chaining, iterators, match patterns, macros, generics)
2. the performance (fast)
3. the safety (strong)
4. the object model (no inheritance, static and dynamic trait objects)
5. a sane and useful build tool

That's just the tip of the iceberg though, so I would also encourage you to take a look at the ""the book"" which has been listed in another comment in the thread :)"

Curious indeed; I'd expect Haskell to be more popular among enthusiasts of mental masturbation."

What kind of projects can you build with Rust compared to JavaScript?"
4,jerknextdoor,1627498827.0,5.0,"Rust is a general purpose, systems level language and capable of writing most anything you want. You can write something as low-level and complex as an operating system (see the recent RFCs to accept it into the Linux Kernel) or even in the browser by compiling it to Web Assembly.

I recommend checking out the main marketing [website](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to get you started."

Also, do you by any chance have some learning resources you can send my way?😊"
6,jerknextdoor,1627501504.0,8.0,"The recommended learning resources can be found on [the website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn). [The book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is where most people start.

I'm not a Blockchain dev so I can't really help you too much. I believe Rust is extremely popular with Blockchain because of speed, safety, and security. Rust is able to give the same performance as C/C++ without nearly the same risks of not being memory safe. Rusts first class support of compiling to Web Assembly (wasm) also seems to be a big benefit to Blockchain because of Wasm's built in sandboxing and ability to run just about anywhere."
