1,jeroenheijmans,1544043084.0,8.0,"Wow, 70+ responses within around an hour already. Thanks everyone for sharing! ❤"
2,BalbinHS,1544046671.0,7.0,I think Elixir should be a listed option for language. (I'd also argue for Crystal but I can understand why that's not there).
3,netcraft,1544062954.0,6.0,"I posted this on HN, but I'd love to see a survey for each day

\- On a scale of 1-10, 1 being you could do  it with your eyes closed, 10 being you thought it was nearly  impossible, how difficult was this puzzle for you?

\- Did you learn  something new because of this puzzle? Could be something about your  language or a library or a new algorithm that helped you solve it.

\- What language(s) did you use to solve this puzzle?

It  could let you compare yourself with other developers - if you thought  it was hard and most others didn't then you would know you might need to  practice something more.  It might be something that would best be  combined with some profile level questions - like their experience level  and primary languages that they use day to day.

It could tell us  that people who used python found this particular puzzle easy (maybe  because of some built in function in the stdlib) but people using some  other language didn't.

Year over year it would be awesome to  compare the languages that people use. Nobody is doing this for their  job supposedly so these are either languages that people enjoy or find  practical. I bet you'd find some correlations though too between  language and how many puzzles they complete in a year - ie people using  language x tend to finish the whole year but language y tend to drop off  after day 10.

4,RadioactiveHop,1544038607.0,11.0,"Why not add some general information about the participant ? e.g. age class, education (IT related or not...), ..."
5,Sharparam,1544039108.0,3.0,"You have Perl in the language list but not Perl 6, should consider adding it :)"
6,Manitary,1544063968.0,2.0,"Why not add a ""other"" option to the language list with a blank space to fill? It would help not having to list more niche/obscure languages, without having users ask to add them here.

~~on a side note, Magma and GAP are missing from the list~~"
7,SmokyTheKoala,1544117800.0,1.0,Where's the BrainFuck option??
8,Reibello,1544050121.0,12.0,"You're a monster, and I love you"
9,hayden592,1544059554.0,4.0,My boss is doing the challenges in excel just to prove a point about functional programming. That and I think he misses dev work
10,minichado,1544057883.0,2.0,I did day 1/2 in excel/VBA... 😎😎😎
11,Cheezmeister,1544063287.0,2.0,Excel is an IDE...
12,SketchySeaBeast,1544059055.0,22.0,Rushing to solve online questions is literally why we are here.
13,jeroenheijmans,1544101598.0,1.0,"Thx for your feedback!

I would _love_ this as well, but I'm afraid we'd only be getting data heavily biased against a specific group of people that love data and doing surveys. Put differently, I'm afraid not to many people would be willing to consistently fill out a survey 25 times (and those that do want to might be a very specific, skewed group)."
14,jeroenheijmans,1544040020.0,4.0,"Good suggestion! Thx for your feedback. I considered it, but left it out of this initial tryout survey, largely because I didn't want to bloat it before I knew if people'd like it.

If it the survey am sich is well received I'll consider adding this as a question to a next survey."
15,jeroenheijmans,1544040104.0,2.0,"TIL about Perl 6 :D

From skimming the sentiment on the web, I presume Perl 6 users will probably proudly fill out ""Other..."" with ""Perl 6"", as opposed to just choosing ""Perl""?"
16,jeroenheijmans,1544101461.0,1.0,"There is an ""Other..."" option (and oh boy, are people using it :D).

PS. You can only have _one_ 'Other...' option, so folks would have to comma-separate multiple options if they want."
17,jeroenheijmans,1544125931.0,1.0,"Are you using that!? Respect, if you do!

(Use the ""Other..."" option at the end if you do :D)"
18,that_lego_guy,1544057926.0,2.0,"Nice, hit me up when you get 4&5 to discuss!"
19,that_lego_guy,1544063492.0,2.0,I’m just an accountant I don’t know these things 
20,Sharparam,1544040864.0,3.0,"That's what I did. I'm a newcomer to Perl 6 and never really learned Perl 5. Perl 6 shouldn't be thought of as an upgrade or continuation of Perl 5, but rather as a new language of its own, at least that's what I've been able to gather.

It's quite nice to work with but it's a shame a lot of things in it are still much slower than other languages in similar categories."
21,Manitary,1544102181.0,2.0,"Ouch, did I miss it the first time? In that case my apologies!

Filled it in, these stats are always interesting."
22,SmokyTheKoala,1544126882.0,2.0,"Lol not this year, but ask me again next year... ;)"
23,minichado,1544060310.0,3.0,"!!! I moved to python because my goal for this month is to brush up on py. I can say day 1 part 2 took 6:30 to run 😂😂😂😂 in vba. 

With my cludgy not efficient vba. 

Day 4 is giving me grief but it would def have been easier in excel. I’m def reading through your solutions though, always fun to use what you’ve got! "
24,Cheezmeister,1544064196.0,4.0,"...and now you do, because I answered your question :D"
25,that_lego_guy,1544061862.0,3.0,Thanks! I love doing them in Excel because a) its what I know and b) I love seeing the look on the face of /u/topaz2078 when I show him my puzzle solution 
26,minichado,1544062449.0,2.0,"my group of guys laughed their asses off too but I got a huge satisfaction when I returned the [right answer on day 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minichado/AdventOfCode-2018/master/AoC%202018%20D2.txt) :D :D 

I'm mostly flexing the developer tab/vba in the background.  day 1 could have been done in the actual spreadsheet, and several of the recent ones would have been easier in the spreadsheet itself I think."
27,that_lego_guy,1544062555.0,1.0,Love the comments. I attempt them in pure excel first as that garnishes the craziest reactions
