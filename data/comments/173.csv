1,ignurant,1622221764.0,14.0,"This week's edition of [Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com) included a link to this year's Stack Overflow Developer Survey. In years past, we often see posts here after the results have been aggregated proclaiming the woes of Ruby's lack of representation. In response to this, it's often discussed that factors like the maturity of Ruby, and different culture in general lead to less participation in Stack Overflow, and therefor in this survey.

I see new people getting into Ruby _all the time_. Go get represented in this survey regardless of whether you are a newbie or an oldie! Represent!"
