You've enough time to think about the future. I think you can surely know what language you'll need when you've got experience. Till then, keep it going."

What is the language with more job opportunities in your area? Try to find what language will get you a job. Getting a job will give you opportunities to learn a lot, faster, and decide better what language you should focus next."
2,SpecificMachine1,1592663435.0,1.0,"There seem to be two (or three) schools of thought on this:

* you should learn whichever language you are learning really well, and either learn other languages according to the market , or wait and see what your employer needs.
* while you are training you should spend some time sampling languages using different paradigms than your main language for mind-expanding purposes.

It seems like which one predominates depends both on the time and the particular forum you are in."
