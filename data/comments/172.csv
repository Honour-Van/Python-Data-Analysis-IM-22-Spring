0,Kardon403,1628152380.0,22.0,Ouch what’s with the wages for flutter/dart developers?
1,Xarion77,1628237615.0,4.0,"The problem with flutter is that companies ask flutter developers to be proficient in either iOS or Android development. Imo, flutter is dedicated to freelancers mostly. I wouldn't invest in it if I wanted to work at a company."
2,Darkglow666,1628194581.0,3.0,"I have always made six figures doing Flutter development in the U.S. I'm a senior dev who's been using Dart since its inception, though."
3,ozyx7,1628195111.0,2.0,"The title makes no sense.  It can't be both 2nd in Loved and 2nd in Dreaded (one is just the other in reverse order).

The actual results are that it's 2nd Loved and 3rd Wanted."
4,Codelessly,1628191525.0,1.0,Incredible!
5,azuredown,1628132831.0,-25.0,So .NET Core is a framework now.
6,ilikerashers,1628159926.0,13.0,"I get the impression mobile devs tend to be in agencies and make less than enterprise devs. Anecdotally, I know 2 devs who came across from react-native to web dev due to bad wages.

I know that building for mobile is often harder but that's the market."
7,David_Owens,1628168106.0,6.0,"$97K average in the USA, according to ZipRecruiter.  $85K average in my area, which a low cost-of-living area."
8,stevenr12,1628183463.0,5.0,The wages are inaccurate. There is a shortage of Flutter developers. We’ve had multiple candidates accept our offer and then get counter offered by their current company because the current company knows how hard it will be to replace them.
9,chris37879,1628179077.0,3.0,"Flutter has caught on overseas a lot and those devs tend to be cheaper, it’s just starting to catch on in the states."
10,GreenMushroomer,1628186090.0,1.0,"We are offering up to $160k fully remote but they seem hard to come by :( . Maybe we are looking in the wrong places, but that included Stack Overflow jobs among others."
11,HaMMeReD,1628191362.0,1.0,"Coming from a mobile background, I do really good in my region, almost exclusively flutter nowaday's, but I do a fair bit of android and ios debugging since we are brownfield.  


That said, there aren't a lot of ""highly skilled"" flutter developers. Not many people have used it professionally, or in top-tier products.  


We still hire mobile android/ios devs with a leaning/willingness to learn flutter. But generally when we find pure flutter dev's, it's not that enticing to us for a variety of reasons."
12,saladthievez,1628144952.0,17.0,What do you / did you think it is?
13,boon4376,1628168864.0,11.0,"If you look at the data, it's global (significant non-USA responses), probably especially for Dart / Flutter. Only \~5,000 survey responses were for flutter, and the wage is basically minimum wage in USA, but may be great pay in Pakistan / India / Etc.

I'm guessing that really dragged down the average.

In the USA, there is a huge shortage of app developers, and flutter is a really great value compared to native dev allowing for great pay."
14,JediBurrell,1629400857.0,1.0,Are y'all still looking?
15,Kardon403,1628186628.0,1.0,Where can I apply!
16,Xarion77,1628237854.0,1.0,"Exactly, learning Flutter sucks. Cause companies still look for native devs mostly who know flutter. You don't have the same issue by learning react.js for instance."
17,azuredown,1628168854.0,-4.0,I always considered it a catch all term for all of Microsoft's programming languages and tools. So calling it a framework is sort of like calling a package manager a framework. Yes... but no. Also I did not expect so many people to actually care about this stuff.
18,JehovahsNutsac,1628215125.0,2.0,"> If you look at the data, it's global (significant non-USA responses), probably especially for Dart / Flutter. Only ~5,000 survey responses were for flutter, and the wage is basically minimum wage in USA, but may be great pay in Pakistan / India / Etc.

*Bingo.* 

Most of the Flutter posts here and even on every other platform, are “not from North America“. Plain and simple.

There shouldn’t honestly be a label as “Flutter Developer”. There’s going to be native coding in all but the simplest of apps. iOS and Android devs (senior level) are making ***well*** North of $100k with salary + benefits + bonuses. Median is about $125k.

$32k is marginally above minimum wage. That’s not accurate if you’re from the U.S. or Canada. That was pure ridiculousness to even put there for fuck sake."
19,Manjru,1628169598.0,7.0,".NET is the catch all term, .NET Core is a specific framework inside .NET."
