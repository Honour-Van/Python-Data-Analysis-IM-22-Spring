29,,1490195051.0,2.0,"> but Mac sort of just works in the way Linux does...

Speaking as someone who owns a couple of Mac's (I don't use primarily) my experience has been the opposite. I find OSX really unintuitive at times. Not having the right-mouse click doesn't help in that regard either.

I do like the ease of installing/removing apps though, in one package. It's nice and shiny too. But it's just not practical. And Linux is catching up with both of those features.

edit: lots of people making a big deal about right-click. Look forgive me for wanting a button! And yes, I've used a normal mouse and the right-click function doesn't consistently work across applications as it would on Linux or Windows, which removes the benefits of using a normal mouse for me.......

I just don't understand Microsoft and Sharepoint.  

It's like Microsoft wanted to build a house. They started off by stacking sticks and rocks to build the walls, but they discovered that sticks and rocks don't stack very well. So they decided to shit in their hands and throw it at the wall. It started to work so they just kept doing that.
However, once they reached 6ft, they started to realize that shit, sticks, and rocks can only work so high.
Rather than think of a solution, they just decided to keep the maximum height to 5ft and build each room as its own building.

I think what you're saying is, ""in order for everyone to use Linux as is, they would have to become sysadmins."" Whereas I don't want Linux to become a common household operating system.

GUI design is complicated, takes a lot of energy to get right, and that would just distract from what Linux is accomplishing. It's no mistake that 95% of web servers are Linux and 99% of supercomputers. It doesn't need to be good at running games and other consumer level stuff.

I guess that's great if you like reading release notes to see if an update's going to break something. Or if you have no interest at all in actually having a stable platform, or being able to make guarantees, or being able to certify anything.

You are missing the point. If you worry about testing each tree, you can easily end up ignoring the health of the forest. Rolling release precludes testing the system as a whole since each element is always in flux. You can't test or certify an operating system in those conditions. You can test individual components, but you can't guarantee that every version of every program, including the complex or essential components, will work correctly with everything else in this sort of context.

The best you can do with rolling release is ""oh, these days it only kills itself every year or so,"" and ""well, that's why you have to pour over release notes every morning."" That's fine for some people with a lot of time on their hands, but I can't really afford to spend time tracking down and fixing a problem caused by some unnecessary update to my system. Which is why Debian sid lives on a VM. If it shits itself I can just go back to last night's snapshot.

You're right. You can't test or vertify a uniform operating system like Debian Stable does. You can, however, ensure wide configuration coverage by having multiple configurations using the Testing repo, which is what Arch does. 

I'm not saying Arch is anywhere near the guarantee of Debian Stable or Ubuntu, I'm saying it has a decent amount of checks and balances which get rid of almost every single issue before being pushed to the main repos. You're vastly overestimating the bleeding part of Arch's bleeding edge.   
For future reference: Arch Testing = Debian Sid+Testing. In addition there's also testing repos dedicated to GNOME and KDE, they're basically Sid for GNOME and KDE respectively.

Just chill. You're blowing this way out of proportion.    
Don't use Arch if you need a 100% guarantee, but if potentially having to downgrade a package like once a year is fine, it's perfect.    
Linux is very different now from how it used to be, the software in general is much more mature and stable.

189,,1490270966.0,1.0,"> So just what OS do you maintain?

All of the common ones. Literally all of them. I run both Windows and Linux servers, both at home and for work. I have Windows, Linux, and Mac desktops and laptops. I use all of them regularly.

Rolling release is a minefield. Enough people have been driving around on it these days that hitting a mine is infrequent, but it still happens.

> Because software and any operating system gets updates over time, risking something breaking.

And ye olde school release-based distributions spend a whole hell of a lot more time certifying that the whole of each release is functional. Moreover, the big release-based distributions do security updates, which means I'm not forced to perform a functional upgrade just to get a security upgrade. Ye olde school backports are sufficient to keep an older distribution usable within its expected life cycle.

Release-based distributions limit the problem of scope too. Since you're only required to guarantee the functionality promised by the release at the time of release, you can spend years making it work better, not years doing unnecessary testing on frequently updated core services and libraries because someone was unhappy with a two year old version of Eclipse."
190,,1490279304.0,1.0,"You're talking about one aspect of a much broader problem. Arch testing packages cannot solve the instability problem--they could release perfect packages that never fail and the system would still be in flux constantly because of their release model. 

That's still unstable because the feature set can vary from week to week, and the schedule of changes is determined by the distribution rather than the administrator. Their lack of support for older software means that you're forced to maintain the standard their leadership sets, not the standard you would choose for yourself. Consider this compared to Ubuntu LTS. With an Ubuntu LTS release, you've got a guaranteed software stack supported for five years and an update every two years. You could skip an entire Ubuntu LTS release and you would still be within the support period. That's an empowering feature, since it puts the update schedule 100% in your hands.

With an Arch release you get... whatever is currently in main, whatever that happens to be. That's fine for a personal desktop, but not for anything serious."

193,,1490280806.0,1.0,"I was actually referring to the possibility of them doing an actual open Linux distribution. They've been working on a lot of newly open sourced software for Linux, it might make sense to build an Azure-focused Linux distribution specifically for making it easy to roll out .NET/Linux VMs. It could come prepackaged with the entire Microsoft-on-Linux stack, include a very Windows-like DE, and come complete with a new set of certificates for MCSEs to have to get."

198,,1490278419.0,1.0,"> Is it not more of a pain though once the life cycle is up and it's time to upgrade to a new release?

No. That happens every 2 years or so. It's a royal pain in the ass every two years, but with proper LTS releases you can migrate on your own schedule and take as long as you need to get it right. Just because Ubuntu 16.04 comes out doesn't mean Ubuntu 14.04 falls out of support--it's still supported until 2019. That lets you upgrade releases when its convenient, or even just wait until its time to change hardware if your have a normal 2 or 3 year lifecycle on hardware.

You can't even do something approximately similar with a rolling release distro. You have to upgrade to the latest just to keep receiving security updates so your upgrade schedule gets dictated to you by the distribution."
199,ase1590,1490240523.0,2.0,"Here's the thing. Drivers are generally built into the Linux kernel. If you don't have the newest Linux kernel, you won't have drivers. Ubuntu is generally behind on kernel releases. Try antergos and see what happens. 

Windows would not be ready for anyone if the drivers were not already there. Did you forget the sudden upgrade of vista to 64 bit? A lot of hardware broke since there was little legacy support initially.

The problems you experienced are due to companies not submitting drivers to the kernel ahead of time before releasing hardware, leaving the community to reverse engineer it and add support. This is why 3-5 year old laptops generally work well on Linux. Time has gone by for the drivers to enter the kernel. 

This is a catch 22 problem, as more people need to use Linux before it gets support, but you need the support to get people. "
