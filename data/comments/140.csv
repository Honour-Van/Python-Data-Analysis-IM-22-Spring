2,jugalator,1628693283.0,9.0,"Rust, Typescript loved languages... Not very surprising...

ASP .NET Core second most loved web framework only after Svelte, and ahead of VueJS and React, quite surprising!"
3,TryingT0Wr1t3,1628686509.0,10.0,Let's learn Clojure
4,ReaccionRaul,1628683085.0,-22.0,Keep dreaming. If developers don't use Linux I don't know who the hell is gonna use it. Compare users regular Mac usage with all linux users usage and probably we will want to cry.
5,Thastertyn,1628843176.0,0.0,the 2000 people when asked what is their race were just “i dont know”
6,Proper_Front8291,1628753605.0,4.0,"Well C# and .NET was always loved (not WebForms tho, but MVC had the best templating language - Razor). One of the few things Microsoft did right."

Now I'm a machine learning engineer, but I started a ASP.NET project to build a internal system.

I've worked with Python, PHP and a little of Java for web-development. I only choose ASP.NET because was the default solution and, working in big corporations, it's easy for me to learn a whole new ecosystem than deploy a different technology.

It's really pleasing to work with ASP.NET, C# is a better Java and the framework seems less clunky than other big ones. Now, I'm happy haha"
8,noomey,1628691747.0,2.0,Yeah!! I've been having a blast with it these past few weeks. I was surprised to see it 2nd most loved language but I understand why now!
9,PangolinZestyclose30,1628687983.0,21.0,"For many devs it's more that they can't use Linux at work. Things like MS Exchange, windows-only software, proprietary VPN setups are usually show stoppers."
10,pdp10,1628692754.0,5.0,"* Exchange supports IMAP, and additionally has its own EWS API that can be accessed from Thunderbird or from non-EWS mail agents using [DavMail](http://davmail.sourceforge.net/) gateway.
* Most enterprise client VPNs are compatible with `vpnc` or with [OpenConnect](https://www.infradead.org/openconnect/protocols.html). Support for small-business type solutions is less well established."
11,ReaccionRaul,1628688294.0,1.0,"Sure, you are totally right. I can't use it at work right now as an example."
12,Atemu12,1628837569.0,1.0,"Yup, that's why I'm typing this on a mac."
13,Atemu12,1628837765.0,1.0,It's not impossible but not something most workplaces would like to support I imagine. Especially w.r.t. security certifications etc.
