2,Emperor_Chad,1650170966.0,18.0,This is some high grade satire
3,Robot_Graffiti,1650177950.0,16.0,"User asked ""how long to boil an egg"" because they put an egg in the toaster for 20 minutes and did not get the result they were expecting

They put an egg in the toaster because they know you don't eat eggs raw, and they heard there are eggs in mayonnaise

They need mayonnaise because they want to eat a BLT"

10,btcgbs,1650163885.0,2.0,"recently read a post where the guy is asking how he could reboot the mchine using C# and mono. instead of answering some dipshit went about ‟why would an application reboot the os especially when it is not running on windows” ... i hate stack overflow because of wankers like this and  the dipshit mods marking everything as duplicate or too broad.


let us not talk about the i -> I edit squad those guys are just pathetic."

18,-Redstoneboi-,1650184594.0,2.0,"it's better on a chatting platform. i frequently ask questions on a discord server for help.

as annoying as it is not immediately knowing how to solve a problem, knowing *why* you're doing something is **far** more important than knowing *how* to do something.

bear with them, answer their question, give them more context, and see what advice they give you.

of course, you have the final say in what answers you accept. just keep them in mind while you're writing, you may later understand their point. or you could prove them wrong. in both cases, you're better off than before."
