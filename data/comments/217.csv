1,budasaurus,1648809609.0,376.0,I like how they tagged it as April fools for those who take it too seriously lol

5,xeio87,1648826485.0,28.0,Am I the only one dissapointed I don't have any 3D glasses handy?
6,imro,1648816400.0,114.0,Scared the shit out of me last night as I was doing some late night research that let me to stackoverflow and it defaulted to the top secret filter. I thought I inadvertently downloaded some malware.
7,ICodeIGuess,1648828491.0,10.0,And the Facebook filter is actually better than the normal design lol
8,mus1Kk,1648810268.0,18.0,I love it! For some reason the fonts are very unevenly pixellated in most designs (Chrome/Mac). But it was still good for a laugh. :)
9,libertarianets,1648828437.0,6.0,"worst part is this:

\-webkit-font-smoothing: none;

god it's so bad"
10,Tintin_Quarentino,1648818405.0,13.0,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but that ""matrix"" (green text on black) is the only dark mode?

Edit - damn I'm dumb af. I didn't realize this was AF's until after reading the other comments."
11,Worried_Lawfulness43,1648840390.0,9.0,Am I the only one that hates this?

Might as well call it a day."
13,jugglingbalance,1648803647.0,13.0,Stack overflow keeping it 5 by 5 up in here.
14,lorslara2000,1648824326.0,10.0,Damn I was hoping they really introduced something like a way to filter out bullshit answers. But then I realized it would filter out about 98 % of that site's content...

17,mikew_reddit,1648841789.0,2.0,Terminal filter (dark mode) is not bad.
18,horreum_construere,1648848421.0,2.0,Top secret is just awesome
19,dunkzone,1648821035.0,6.0,"I got hit by this when I was having a late night learning sesh. I was super wrapped up in what I was working on, having a blast, then I hit this. I know I'm humorless, but I was really annoyed. Or, it could have been that it was 11:30 pm and I didn't realize April Fool's was tomorrow and I was really confused lol."

The only downside is they'd lose a lot of their users"

25,Arm85,1648804604.0,-49.0,They got rid of jobs.. But still have time for rediculous April fools. Outrageous.
26,jevon,1648844323.0,1.0,I'm so happy hot dog made the cut 😍

35,unmannedidiot1,1648853833.0,0.0,"Ooh it was because of April's fool.

I was already looking for an alternative to stack overflow because I thought that was permanent."
36,Fahrradkette,1648827551.0,113.0,I feel the biggest joke here is that these themes are available for everyone while the regular dark mode requires you to create an account.
37,fecal_brunch,1648866416.0,5.0,"There is already a dark mode, no?"
38,TheKeg,1648863008.0,19.0,have you tried the [dark reader extension](https://darkreader.org/)?
39,Altruistic_Fan_68,1649187757.0,1.0,It's sad that it's a joke because I actually really liked it.
40,-Phinocio,1648825985.0,77.0,"I think more places should do that in general tbh. This one by stackoverflow is kinda on the nose and obvious, but there's been times I've come across things months after the fact that seem legit, but the only indication of it being a joke is the date posted itself (and with timezones, that's not always April 1 for me anyway)."
41,nifty-shitigator,1648812231.0,104.0,Or for those of us who are dumb because we're still waking up :(

47,knightcrusader,1648822521.0,39.0,"Yeah, the matrix one is easier on my eyes."
48,smiler82,1648835091.0,19.0,I had some but the effect didn't really work :(
49,dream-lotus,1648826178.0,33.0,Yeah it opened up on the 3D for me last night and I thought my laptop dock was bugging out for a minute before I realized it's an April Fool's thing.
50,appsecSme,1648862217.0,2.0,"Yeah, a developer at work posted in our security slack about it, thinking that he had malware."

53,tooclosetocall82,1648860468.0,3.0,I was using the Win 3.1 one today until that started bothering me. I figured it was on purpose because font smoothing wasn’t a thing back then.
54,PkmnSayse,1648826967.0,12.0,StackOverflow has a dark mode anyway it’s in your user settings

59,Lonsdale1086,1648822529.0,2.0,"I had the exact same thing, but already had a Stylus theme on so it barely changed anything.

Just thought ""these are a bit weak"" and kept moving."
60,megaglacial,1648827696.0,2.0,"for whatever reason I was seeing this yesterday morning, not on April fool's, while dealing with a particularly annoying bug and was like ""what the hell, why would they do this"" when the top secret filter started hiding parts of questions and answers. thankfully they made it easy to turn off but for a second there I was confused and pissed off"
61,tlphong,1648809681.0,20.0,"In the bottom of the screen should have a bar to select different type of filter. The left most filter type is the ""normal"" one"
62,smors,1648809535.0,9.0,Probably b waiting till tomorrow where it will no longer be april 1st.
63,SkyyySi,1648811389.0,16.0,"Having humor helps. Otherwise just wait 'till tomorrow. They also once announced you'd have to pay a premium for copying text once, they do dumb shit like this every years lol"

67,gnoodl,1648854546.0,2.0,Pretty sure it came on at midnight UTC
68,rohmish,1648875321.0,4.0,I don't frequent stack overflow much these days and it always logs me out. It's always a pain to sign in just to read one answer (i know it's just a theme but it kinda bothers me)
69,Suekru,1648864272.0,9.0,+1 for this extension. Some sites it’s not perfect on but you can easily disable it site by site basis. Overall much better web experience
70,Junkymcjunkbox,1648829079.0,42.0,I didn't need any more help waking up after that Hotdog Stand theme almost lasered my retinas off.
71,ianitic,1648844244.0,3.0,Or people on at midnight and didn't understand why everything went blurry all of a sudden lol.

75,CyAuo6Q3WkjH,1648846650.0,7.0,I spent an hour on SO yesterday bewildered by what they were doing to the UI. It just dawned on me today it was an April fools thing
76,Tintin_Quarentino,1648827059.0,2.0,"Yeah that's my default. I was just looking for a ""dark filter"" in these new filters."
77,lorslara2000,1648828367.0,6.0,"Lol. No, I just dislike the format. 

""Here, you need to do like this""
+358 votes and a green tick marks ""right"" answer.

And no sources, no elaboration.

Yes, there are exceptions but that's exactly what they are - exceptions.

Like, if you know how to do something, why don't you also point me to the right spot in the reference manual so I can see for myself. Or at least elaborate!"
78,maest,1648816982.0,-56.0,"I'll fuck your mum as a joke. When you complain, I'll say ""having humor helps""."
79,gay_for_glaceons,1648834249.0,2.0,"Oh, Stack Overflow did the hot dog stand theme too?  This could definitely result in some confusion..."
80,thoomfish,1648845757.0,2.0,I was confused about your complaint until I realized Dark Reader was defanging most of the worst of the filters. Then I turned it off. Truly hideous.
81,SangeetDev,1648886075.0,1.0,I call it the 90s abandoned school bus theme.
