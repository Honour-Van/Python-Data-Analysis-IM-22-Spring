4,barret232hxc,1520955925.0,44.0,In my experience.  Switching from the games industry to software was somewhat sickening.  I say this because I work three times less but make three times more.  The one main difference I've noticed is that people in the games industry were much more passionate and because you spent so much time together you felt more like family than co-workers.  I do miss it at times.

That's 12k less than the top developer role. The [Salary and Experience by Developer Type](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#work-salary-and-experience-by-developer-type) graph also shows that their ""Game or graphics developer"" data is based on nearly the lowest possible average years of experience.

Also, if you're a game Technical Director (high end of the technical pay scale), would you answer this survey as ""Game or graphics developer"" or ""Engineering manager""? On the low end, ""game developer"" could include indies paying themselves nothing before ship and designers who do scripting (Unity uses C# for scripting and there's lots of Unity answers on Stack Overflow).

All that said, high end Silicon Valley jobs definitely pay better than game dev jobs. Looking at Paysa.com was depressing.

For the $40k global salary... I don't even know what that means. I'm not in US and made more than that as a new grad at EA.

It's a shame, I'd also love to work for a company like SpaceX, but to me respect is a two way street, unless I'm gaining a value other than monetary (like massive skill increase, or something I can take to a future career, living the dream doesn't count as value) that displaces that monetary loss then I can't see myself working in that job."

You likely won't work a 40 hr week every week, but many of us have families/friends that we love hanging out with and are in this for the long haul so we know we need to have a positive work/life balance.

While there are a decent amount of young developers that leave the industry after burning out, even the top developers get paid much less than they would in another industry. 

I could be making nearly twice my salary at a traditional software company. My ex (who is an amazing programmer with 14 years of industry experience), was constantly being pestered by one of our friends at Google who promised him easily double, if not close to triple his compensation (this friend had under half the amount of experience already was making over double what my ex was). 

The reason the game industry pays less is because they can. Supply and demand. Many find it much more interesting to work on games than on enterprise software. And, sometimes, the choice is between ""a pretty comfy life with a job I'm passionate about"" and ""a lavish life with a job I hate."" And you know what? Tons of people pick the second option, but there's still far more people who pick the first than the relatively small game industry can support."

The difference in pay can be quite large, depending on where you work. Some of them making fairly decent 6-figure pay in non-gamedev work. I've even been through a few interviews for jobs that start new guys at over 100k and it was mostly front end work for some no-name app."

You have to maintain servers for online multiplayer. You need to replace high end computers with other high end computers every development cycle. Nobody wants to buy dlc, nobody wants to buy special editions, and not even gamedevs like lootboxes. And nobody wants to buy your game at full price anymore - they'll buy used or in a Steam sale, so good luck convincing developers to increase their MSRP when gamers have workarounds.

Basically, for a work visa, if a company wishes to sponsor you, they get a certificate of eligibility, send it to you, you take that and a bunch of other documents to your local embassy, and then wait for the visa to come. If all documentation is in order, your visa will be granted within a month or so.

So if you have a Japanese company willing to hire you, it's very easy for them to get you a visa. I know at Square Enix, while I worked there, it was pretty quick for them to hire any foreigner they wished.

The main difficulty comes in the language. The working language in pretty much all studios in Japan is Japanese. If you speak it, excellent. If you don't, you'll have a hard time communicating. 

They are also usually looking for experienced people, if they're hiring from abroad. If you don't have experience, and can afford to go to university in Japan, that is also a possible path, because Japanese studios also hire new graduates every year.

The types of problems are also more to my liking. Like how to create a battle manager AI that creates meaningful/interesting battle encounters for the player, how to manage the AI during battle, or how to implement an IK system for making this massive snake-like monster look and act in a more snakey way. And then seeing people test these things, get their reaction, work on it again, tweak it, twist, see the results, see the game released, people playing, looking at the fruits of your work.

172,barret232hxc,1521001187.0,7.0,"I'm going to try to answer this the best I can think of answering it. I went to school for game development and design graduated in 2007 at full sail university. Many of my graduating class we all got jobs in the games industry but 2008-2009 was a rough time in the economy for the games industry so that shook things up. The layoffs kept going and eventually everyone in the company got let go right before christmas. Several of us formed our own company but then the two main artists left so we couldn't proceed b/c they owned the IP we were working on for our game. 

Then shortly after that my sister passed away and I fell into a deep depression and I was out of the games industry for several years. I got back into it working for the company that makes the game engine called gamebryo used in oblivion and fallout 3. after epic games released the unreal engine at a subscription model we couldn't really compete as well so the usa office got shut down and I found myself thinking now that I'm older do I want to continue this path. So I looked for any job and that's how I got into software it was completely by accident. 

Now that I'm in software I've even had epic contact me but I know that I would have to take a cut in pay and work more hours. Now that I'm married and trying to have more of a family life that type of work life balance isn't as attractive to me personally (even though I miss the games industry) 

so that's a brief history of my experience. Now if you were to ask me if I could back in time would I have started out in software first and skipped games I would have to say no, I would do it exactly the same way again. Only difference is that I would of learned programming younger. Going to school I met some of the most awesome individuals who I still keep in touch with. One of my friends even works at rockstar games. And I learned so much at the companies I worked with and I think the experience was totally worth it. I truly appreciate all the hard work gamedevs put into their games. 

so my compromise right now is that I'm trying to do my own game on the side while working my day job in software. Learning how to do things myself rather than bigger teams is a learning process overall but it's been rewarding and it's somewhat of a stress relief that I don't have to succeed with my being a game developer to keep food on the table for my family. 


I think game developers are some of the most dedicated and talented people out there. So if you are passionate if you enjoy it, then I say to go for it. Especially if you are still young and you don't have too much of a family to support at the moment. I say this not to discourage having a family but you may have to move around to find the job you want and usually that's harder when you have a family. I don't mean to scare anyone away from game dev. I just want to be open and honest about the realities I've seen in my own experiences and my friends because gamedev is almost more than a career it's a bit of a lifestyle. And I don't think everyone is ready for that.

sorry for this really long post. I dunno if it all makes sense. I am very open to talking about it and think it's important because sometimes we only see the successful people or we don't know how they got to where they are because we live in this day and age where so many things are instant.  So I think it's good to see and hear from multiple people and sometimes the risk is worth the reward. It's all about what do you want to get out of it. "

But to be fair, I don't think there is necessarily a strong correlation between ""job I'm passionate about:game dev"" and ""job I hate:regular software dev job"" except for people who haven't actually worked in either yet. I think I've heard a lot more horror stories of devs being worked to the bone in constant crunch mode working in the games industry than at the software companies that typically pay top dollar. 

Working at one of the latter, what I work on is technically ""enterprise"" but it's also at a scale possibly no other company operates at, and with technologies no one else is building or using yet - so it's pretty easy to get passionate about it. Whereas when I was graduating I had job offers from pretty well know games companies that were for positions on really boring sounding projects (writing tooling for designers, QA and test automation, ordering and customer tracking systems etc). The exciting positions in game design or engine design are not common or entry level.

I DID let the asshole know that i had no money, even before i left Santiago i went to his office and told him the situation and THEN i left to my hometown to gain some money back. I told him that i would not be able to make it back this month, he knew that so stop fuckin asking bullshit about it.

Why didn't i get it back: Again at the time i had no money, only way to get it back is with a lawyer and going to court. Both things take an insane amount of both money and time (See the relation??) and then again, there is no way to truly know that the computer will be there! By the time i get an order the dude could just take it to his home and nobody would even know! I WON'T WASTE ANY MORE OF MY MONEY AND TIME ON HIM. Lawyer + Transportation + The money that i'll have to invest to bring back all of my stuff. Not worth it.

In the end it all comes down to this, i was an immature young man that wasn't able to live by himself in the city, ran out of money to the point of not having a place to sleep and i had to go back to town, defeated with no immediate way to make it back.

He had me working for free with no compensation, using my stuff for months and wasn't able to say, ""hey it's ok i get it, i'm a professional and as the boss of this ""company"" i will keep your things until you are able to come for them"" NOPE he said, ""i'll take your shit, cause i never gave you money and you stupidly ran out of it and now you can't come back.""

It's actually starting to pick up again after the long decline with sustained union busting efforts; the precarity and abuse workers are subjected to has just gotten to be too much for the threat of retaliation to deter any longer. This time around it's more educated labor fields than the manual labor/skilled trade ones that have historically been the vanguard of unionization, too, along with an increase in service industry unions.

And yeah, software and game devs desperately need to unionize, a task made somewhat more difficult both by how disposable they're considered by companies (and that extends up to entire studios; a common union busting practice is just closing up any shop or factory that unionizes and publishers close or gut studios for little or literally no reason as it is) and the reactionary egoist beliefs that an unfortunate number of engineers have internalized..."

That's literally every business. Our entire economic model revolves around ""efficiently"" finding the absolute least workers can be compensated while ""efficiently"" separating that pittance from them again as quickly as possible - by hook or by crook - so that the idle oligarchs born to wealth can amass ever more absurd fortunes. The only solution in the short term is spreading unionization and supporting workers rights initiatives - including minimum wage increases regardless of one's current pay.

I live south of Kyoto in a less touristy area, so it's not a problem. But whenever I have to go to Kyoto, it can be a bit of a pain, specially in the areas with the more touristy temples. I can't imagine what hassle it must be to live near Kinkaku-ji or Kiyomizu, or the palace, or the castle. Bus lines in those areas are always full of tourists, some who are very inconsiderate carrying massive backpacks or suitcases during other people's commutes.

296,barret232hxc,1521005061.0,3.0,"well at my current job my weekly work hours are 37.5 hours a week and that includes paid lunch. while working at the first game company during crunch for meeting a milestone at the first game company I worked at I was at the office for 32 hours before I went home. Now this wasn't all the time. We had a producer that sort of put a midnight cut off time for crunching since we'd be basically out an entire day after working 24+ hours. The first company I worked at I actually started out as QA and I got to do some development on nintendo ds for a few projects but it was mostly scripting work nothing fancy. I would say 50-60 hours a week was normal but then you'd have some crazy 80 hours weeks with a 24+ hour day in to meet a milestone. The reason the crunch was there was b/c the owners of the company didn't get paid by the publishers unless we finished the milestone

now working for the game engine company wasn't as bad because it was mostly dealing with customers who were using their game engine. I was a support engineer meaning I would have to look at other companies projects and find out if there was a bug in our engine or their project and then fix the issue if it was in our engine or help them fix the issue in their project if it was something within our scope. I also had to work with the different consoles and make sure new features weren't broken on the different consoles and try and figure out how to fix them if they did break them. Eventually I even got to work from home sometimes and the main company owners were in Korea so I had to do some odd hours for meetings and communication

being a game developer can mean several things. There are specializations you can focus in on. like the most basic is usually gameplay programmers who work on the features and gameplay. then you have graphics programmers who work on implementing shaders and different things related to optimizing. you have network programmers who focus on anything with the infrastructure and netcode. You may have some programmers who work mostly on tools that the designers and artists will use

then usually you might have some artists who focus on on the art  for the environments and texturing and you have 3d modelers and you have artists that specializing in rigging the models. and you might even have a technical artists who know more about shaders. probably have some artists that focus on the UX and gui. and you will usually have some level designers who may do some form of scripting. and you might have some writers who focus on dialogue and story and usually a lead designer and junior designers who actually design all the gameplay mechanics that the gameplay programmers are going to program.

Some of these names may be called different things in different companies but generally there are a lot of things you can do within game design and development so there is lots of opportunities for doing different things.


Like me personally am not really about writing complex shaders and netcode. I like doing fun stuff like gameplay and controls and adding in all the effects and polish stuff."

The industry is hyper-competitive and skilled developers want in regardless of that. These developers have much higher paying job alternatives that still have them programming, and they are just choosing not to take them which is why it's hard to blame them. Like I said, some of us don't think it's worth it and choose not to be in that industry, but many many more do and that's the price you pay.

Remember, game devs at larger companies are still paid relatively good as far as the average person, they just aren't making what developers in other industries are making which is fine.

373,tchuckss,1520988533.0,15.0,"It is quite true. Employees are expected to stay on until late, specially if you're a full time employee and your overtime only kicks in very late at night (so you stay until then). As a foreigner, you're not expected to work as long as natives do, but you're still expected to deliver great results, which is fine. No-one makes a fuss about you leaving on time and, while some people may not like it, they won't voice their discontent and it won't impact your evaluations.

Lots of meetings too. Things need to be in agreement by a lot of people before being implemented and put into the game. Since people work long hours, its also common to see employees casually dozing off on their desks or during meetings. It only becomes an issue if they start snoring! (Which I've seen/heard happen! Did not reflect well on that poor dude)

It does dominate the lifestyle in the sense that work is more important than family, hence why you have the cases of people working to death which, although rare, still happen. The government has been trying to crackdown on those kinds of things, and try to get people to have a better work-life balance, but it doesn't really work. The latest attempt was the ""premium friday"", where every last friday of the month, employees are supposed to leave work early and enjoy their personal time. But it didn't actually work, and most companies either don't observe premium friday, or the workers just stay on to continue working anyway.

From what I've seen, though, working on the weekends isn't mandatory, and in the game industry at least only happened during crunch times. And you need permission to come in on the weekends.

EDIT: One thing that I forgot to mention, and that is completely different from western studios, is that your job security here in Japan is simply amazing. As a regular employee, it's nearly impossible to be fired, and layoffs are pretty much unheard of. They always have enough projects at hand to move you around if need be, but firing you is their extremely last recourse."
374,tchuckss,1520989001.0,5.0,"It is optimistic, but you don't need extreme fluency to work in game development here. I have a friend who has been here in Japan for 6 years now, and barely speaks a word of Japanese. Working in games. His main thing was that he was hired by the more foreigner division of the company, so he was able to get by without speaking a lick of Japanese, but still inside the country he can get by without it. 

Since most communication is digital, knowing enough to know what you need to search and how you'd have to write it is good enough. Leads are always happy to email you about things that were discussed in a meeting and then it makes it much easier to read/reread/translate and understand. People here are very open to questions too, and since communication is important (and miscommunication between Japanese also common), they are happy to answer your questions.

Dude, you said it yourself. Best thing you can do. If he denies then stick with your current plan if you don't want to waste time on a lawyer.

You're missing all the shots you don't take. You have a story, possibly papers of proof of purchase, his message, and can set up a physical demand with police present and state you'll escalate this situation. If you somehow get your PC back, that's 600 dollars you just bought back that will greatly speed up your process of becoming the game designer & programmer that you want to be.

You need to take the shot, instead of back off. You worked hard screwing yourself over just to get screwed over.

So, think of it as a college that stops after two years. You can often transfer to a four-year college and pick up where you left off. You could spend two years at community college and get an associate’s degree in chemistry, then spend two years at a different college and get a bachelor’s degree in chemistry.
