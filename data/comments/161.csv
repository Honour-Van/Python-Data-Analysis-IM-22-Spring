1,PlayingTheWrongGame,1590797602.0,1.0,"> I work 90% alone on a new project which I am effectively the lead developer on. 

This is an awful position for a new developer to be in. You learn *so* much by working with other developers, especially developers who are much more experienced than you are.

> What would you do if you were me?

Take the other job. Career growth is really important, and your current position sounds stagnant. A stagnant career is a dying career. Even if your take-home income is a bit lower, it won't be for long and the US is a much stronger market for software development work."
2,migueldias1212,1590837204.0,1.0,"I would try to get multiple offers so that you can negotiate and raise your TC. I don't know if you're willing to have another minimum of 1-3 months of applying, interviewing and negotiating though"

4,endlessvoidofdespair,1590797905.0,1.0,Total Comp is a significant increase - about a 78% increase when compared in the same currency....however cost of living based on [this](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&city1=Jersey+City%2C+NJ&country2=Canada&city2=Toronto&amount=120000&displayCurrency=USD) is about 25% higher

Yeah I see your point - completely valid. In one respect it was good because it allowed me to take deep dives into areas I wanted to explore, understand and work through solutions on my own....  


At the same time I'm never able to evaluate whether my solutions are good or bad without someone with more experience chiming in and doing code reviews.  For all I know my code is dogshit..."
6,endlessvoidofdespair,1590838912.0,1.0,"I am willing to a degree.  I kinda detest grinding leetcode & hackerrank though... I've just started interviewing at a couple other companies.  I don't typically get much overlap in offers because they've all been only valid for a few days...  


What do you think would be a fair ask from a $110k offer?"
7,endlessvoidofdespair,1590851498.0,1.0,"is it worth negotiating to squeeze more money out of my offer?  I'm a touch disappointed in it.... I was expecting $125k at a minimum to be honest. Considering the fact the recruiter mentioned he got a green-light from everyone who interviewed me and they really liked me and the fact he said ""I'm sure you are going to be very-happy with what he have to offer"""
8,Hot_Surprise2,1590798037.0,2.0,So you still come out way ahead...  And it helps raise your total lifetime earnings significantly...
9,migueldias1212,1590839878.0,1.0,"So the best way to improve an offer's TC is to have multiple offers, as they are your leverage in the negotiation process. Check out this tutorial on how to do that:
https://medium.com/@bayareabelletrist/how-i-negotiated-a-software-engineer-offer-in-silicon-valley-f11590f5c656?

I applied this method and increased my TC by 8% straight out of my bachelor's ,but I think that you'll be able to get more because you have more experience.

There's nothing you can do about exploding offers except applying to more places...."
