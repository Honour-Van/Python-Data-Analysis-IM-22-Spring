0,MaxObjFn,1611251782.0,3.0,Most dreaded language... lol.  Thanks for sharing.
1,stretch350,1611250518.0,2.0,Very interesting!  Thanks for sharing.
2,sancarn,1611406059.0,2.0,"I think the most interesting questions would be, using the same logic:

1. What is the most dreaded language for ""Data or business analyst""
2. What is the most dreaded language for ""I am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work""

The reason I ask these questions is to me it is totally obvious that a full stack/back end/desktop application/front end developer wouldn't want to use VBA. They have much better tools at their disposal. The important question really is, how is VBA rated where it's most used, imo.

Would be worth mentioning that the data can be downloaded from here:

3,eerilyweird,1611294963.0,1.0,Was R not one of the options on the survey?  I'd have expected more VBA users to use R than some of the others listed.

5,tagapagtuos,1611309304.0,1.0,"[Here's the link](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology) to the original survey insights. R was among the choices, albeit having lesser users compared to VBA (VBA had less than 3.5K users out of 65K)."
6,tagapagtuos,1611325501.0,1.0,Corey went hard on stl. I might as well do it. Because I can.
