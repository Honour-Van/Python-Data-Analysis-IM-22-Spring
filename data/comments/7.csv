But I read the screen that said you could access help by pressing keys and when I wanted to get out of that I read the screen. It said you can exit with :q so I did that.

Dishonesty.

Nano is one of the best minimalistic and user friendly editors there is.

Straight to the point like Notepad but still with many shortcuts, of which the main ones are by the way listed on the bottom of the screen at all times if you need, most particularly the one for quitting.

And extensibility with a full-fledged config file and many commands and settings if you ever want to do that.

And finally `Ctrl-X` is not that different from `:x`, and prompts you for writing or not if any change (again a good point for beginners), which then accomplishes the same as `:x` in an interactive manner."

It is not about being dumb or smart. It is just they are first timers or inexperienced vim users. Vim(vi) was developed for Unix which later became vim.

Yes. Vim is difficult to learn.

Some images don't load depending on which backend site is hosting it (and are loading fine on the reddit app).

 Other things like unsubscribing of which Slide gives 2 different buttons for it : ""remove and unsubscribe"" which is supposed to unsubscribe as normal but also remove it from the list of your subreddits, whereas ""just unsubscribe"" would still keep the sub in the list which would be a really cool feature. However using the latter still remove the sub from the list, so all this is only achieving more clogging of the UI.

Moreover subs can be added more than once to the list if you tap another time soon enough (cause there's no pop up confirming the action..), and then it's a real mess to get back to a normal 

And lastly, the placement of n-th nest-level comment, while it was a good idea to add colors for each nest level, it's still far too compressed and it's a real headache to clearly see the parent node of a given comment for deeply nested posts.

Nothing lol.

There is ""boost for reddit"" which is supposed to be extremely customizable and I believe the most popular android reddit alternative app, but for whatever reason at the time (I think it was even more broken but not sure) I ditched it and settled with Slide for a 2nd reddit app so I can't recommend it. It has an active subreddit tho. But I don't think it's FOSS.

And I have to be honest, I can't really compare an app published by the owner company of the website browsed, and a multi-billion multinational one at that, to a free community project that lives on volunteering.

I actually switched when there was an update in the official app that caused everything to open in Chrome. Obviously, I hated it and tried resetting it to Firefox to no avail.

It has a UI that's somewhat close to the original, customisable to a good extent, more featured, and is FOSS. I found no reason to change.

You're totally right :). I like those rare healthy reddit discussions !

The actual deal breaker to me was the impossibility to display some images as I mentioned. Just opened the app right now and the second post I see is a gif hosted gfycat.com for which I get an error. Besides this I agree that the other issues are not significant. But this one, which means I lose a fraction of the total reddit content, I can't live with it.
