Source: I'm not looking for a job and I skipped the survey."
1,OldMiner,1402438138.0,4.0,"Is this why recruiters keep contacting me even though I checked the ""Not looking for a job right now"" box on every site?"
2,,1402448020.0,5.0,Also: 1/2 of all devs write shitty code.
3,SoMegaShameless,1402452338.0,5.0,Am I the only one who can't use this site. I literally get a pit in my stomach at how confusing it is.
4,bigdubb2491,1402451018.0,2.0,"This surprises me. It took us nearly two years to fill an open position.  There simply isn't enough qualified good developers in my area of the US.  If memory serves correctly unemployment for a developer in the Twin Cities(Minneapolis, St. Paul metro area) is at 0%.  There are more jobs than people at the moment.  Heck, we can't even find a QA person.  Quite frustrating.  "
5,thusiasm,1402433388.0,1.0,I will take their old job.
6,njchava,1402491791.0,1.0,"1. As it's phrased it doesn't mean they are unemployed only that they are looking for a NEW job

2. Unemployed are much more likely to be filling this out

3. There a lot of rookie / self-titled devs that aren't that great at what they do. Those people tend to be under/unemployed. "
7,shady_mcgee,1402450710.0,10.0,"It's much higher than that. Hell, even if you're a good dev and look at your code from 2 years ago you'll probably think it's shit. (If you don't think it's shit it means you haven't learned anything in two years, which is much worse)"
8,sakaem,1402459472.0,2.0,"While I know about the pit in your stomach that you are talking about, I also think that for the functionality they are offering it should be alright to also have a learning curve.

9,Misaiato,1402451677.0,10.0,"Why don't companies like yours hire remote workers?  I own a home in Dallas, I'm not moving my family for a ""might be cool"" job. 

All jobs fall into this category. "
10,,1402451743.0,2.0,I take it it was senior position requiring five-plus years minimum experience?
11,,1402453423.0,1.0,We have been looking for a php dev for over 6 months. Found one that was decent but he ended up taking another offer. It's tough to find anyone. 
12,,1402434273.0,2.0,You can have mine. 
13,rurounijones,1402474663.0,2.0,"Agreed.

When your biggest hiring requirement is ""Must live close to St. Paul, Minneapolis"" (And it is implicitly in this case) you cut your applicant pool by probably 99.999% of the global talent pool (and probably a significant number of 9s from just people living in the US).

GP already identified the problem in that all local devs are hired so they either needs to A) Offer more money to lure local devs or B) expand their recruiting pool of which allowing remote working is probably the biggest possible expansion.

Not that remote working doesn't have its challenges but doesn't everything."
14,Not-original,1402456118.0,9.0,Five years in Swift. 
15,bigdubb2491,1402460185.0,1.0," I would consider it a mid-jr level position.  For Sr. roles we like people with 10 yrs or more development experience.   I guess I look at it as it takes time to build a craft, such as development, the soft skills take time.  

One a side note, for those others looking, just thought I'd share:  We don't necessarily look for 100% of the skill sets to be met, in the ball park is good enough.  I've started looking for people with a natural desire to learn and a natural curiosity about life in general.  I've found these types of developers tend to not shy away from new technologies, and tend to be relatively comfortable with change.  Having a natural desire to learn might be the strongest selling point that  I'm looking for.  It's proven to be quite successful so far.

16,vishbar,1402491293.0,2.0,Are you paying enough?
17,Isvara,1402495727.0,2.0,Show us your job ad. You must be doing something wrong. PHP developers are two-a-penny.

Natural curiosity.  

For those not in Mpls. The current is a local public radio station. Claiming to celebrate Local musicians and independent music.  For the post part it's not 'horrible' but there has been a clear change in the play list and this guy quantifies it.  Kind of cool.  "
19,,1402507897.0,2.0,"Yes, 80k - 90kish for a mid level developer. "
20,,1402508011.0,1.0,"There are plenty of terrible PHP devs that have WordPress experience. The hard part is finding good ones that have worked on ""enterprise"" applications. "
21,milkmymachine,1402730744.0,1.0,"Holy shit I'm at the wrong place, where at? "
22,Isvara,1402509068.0,1.0,"> The hard part is finding good ones that have worked on ""enterprise"" applications.

Then why not look for Java programmers? Or just programmers? Someone doesn't have to be ""a PHP programmer"" in order to write PHP for you. Learning PHP would be the easiest part of their job. In fact, I started my previous job doing what you might call enterprise PHP and Perl, despite not claiming to be either a PHP programmer or a Perl programmer. It was hardly a disadvantage."
