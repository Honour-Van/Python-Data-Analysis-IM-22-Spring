MariaDB started life as a fork, but has diverged far enough to have some compatibility issues. This combined with many applications still being built for MySQL, developers used to manually downloading and installing MySQL, and managed cloud database services supporting MySQL before Maria (if they even support Maria at all), it's not surprising that MySQL is the more commonly-used option."

Me too! Maybe organizations already using MySQL don't see the need to switch to MariaDB or maybe they like having paid support. For a small personal project, I used MariaDB and really liked it.

>AWS usage is about double that of Azure

AWS seems really popular with developers. I wonder if corporate IT environments are also tending to use AWS more than Azure. I think Azure makes sense if an organization is already using Microsoft 365 services. (but I don't claim to be an expert on cloud platforms so please don't take offense to this if you prefer AWS)

I remember seeing that previous years, but I think it's more because they're ancillary skills in some high paying stuff, like Sysadmin. If you're a good SA and earning big money, chances are you're also good at scripting, but it's not really your 'primary skill'."

18,jturp-sc,1590672608.0,10.0,"I had similar thoughts with respect to Azure. Obviously, there's going to be organizations that test all cloud platforms, but I feel like there's two immediately obvious camps:

* Cloud-native software development companies that are going to be on AWS (or GCP if they want to be trendy and hip)
* Corporate IT environments that don't really have a software development arm and extending into Azure is a natural extension of their current vendor stack"
19,sigger_,1590678083.0,6.0,"From what I can tell, AWS is the choice for environments that are tech/dev focused, or if they have internal/home built software that is logically separate from their corporate network. Azure is the choice when you want your network to be moved into cloud. Azure is facilitated by native integration with AD, and Office 365. Azure has AzureAD, device control similar to group policy, etc. - it’s essentially just Windows Server 2016 but dissected into the cloud, for the most part (in the way that most companies use it), plus the added functionality of having some AWS-like tools, which seem to be far less popular, but alright if you’re trying to keep billing/vendors down. 

AWS is used more, in my experience, for technical roles in technical companies. Sure, they both have serverless runtimes (logic apps vs lambda), they both have storage, VMs, VNets/VPCs, etc., but S3 beats Storage Accounts every time, DyanamoDB seems to be beating CosmoDB, AWS has things like BeanStalk and AppMesh and Cognito, which Azure is having a hard time competing with because most of Azure’s use cases aren’t dev related. It’s for sysadmin. And StackOverflow is definitely more commonly used by devs, even though there are ample resources for sysadmins and the like, so that bias is not surprising. 

Just a ramble on my experiences and thoughts working extensively with both. 

Either way, if you search up “azure” and “AWS” on indeed, you will find a hell of a lot more jobs for AWS, at least in my area (big ass east coast city)."
20,kgbdrop,1590680730.0,5.0,"> I wonder if corporate IT environments are also tending to use AWS more than Azure.

As someone from a software vendor whose customers are transitioning to the cloud, my 2 cents:

If the customer was in the cloud 1.5 years ago, they are in AWS. If the customer is based out of the West Coast of the US, they are likely in AWS. If the customer is East Coast US, or EMEA based, then Azure is rapidly gaining ground. US Fed: AWS for now, but JEDI may change that.

If the customer is building a cloud native stack, AWS or GCP. Azure isn't too terrible for this, but Azure is a Corporate IT play at this point.

Azure adoption is skyrocketing in the US. Microsoft are absolutely savage about getting people onto their platform. While I am not a Microsoft hater by any means, I suspect many companies are going to regret this.

29,eruffini,1590678937.0,6.0,"In my personal opinion the term ""Systems Administrator"" can be a significantly wide description for many jobs/paths. SRE's tend to be more specialized with a heavy focus on programmatic automation and similar tasks, so the pool will definitely be smaller.

With that being said, some of the tasks and responsibilities do overlap - especially when it comes to automation and ""infrastructure as code""-type skillsets. Pet vs. cattle mentality and way of operating I guess."
30,theevilsharpie,1590701392.0,5.0,"> Totally unrelated comment, but you're bringing up the pay difference between SRE and sysadmin. What's the core difference between the two, to justify such a large pay gap?

SREs typically develop and support production infrastructure for some type of engineering-related organization, whereas System Administrator has essentially come to mean some type of office IT support. There is some overlap in skills (particularly for Linux sysadmins), but the worlds are very different, and you can see this for yourself if you compare /r/sysadmin and /r/devops for a while.

The pay for SREs is probably a bit inflated in the surveys, because there are environmental variables affecting pay that work in SRE's favor (SREs will tend to cluster in established tech companies or later stage startups that can afford to pay higher salaries, since smaller startups can use a managed service and/or task a dev with the Ops work). However, the pay gap is real, and is largely due to office IT not being that valuable."

If you look at the history of the platforms, GCP's the only one of the three that really pushed 'cloud-native' principles from day 1 (their first service was app engine--a platform that abstracts away underlying compute vs. AWS's first service being EC2--a platform that abstracts away the hypervisor). It's probably a significant contributor to them being an afterthought for folks. It's a lot easier for a cloud-naive dev/technical founder to just shit their code onto some bespoke EC2 VM than it is to trust some 'app engine' black magic."

Puppet+Bolt is a great platform for us.  Bolt makes the down-side of agent based cfg management go away.  Terraform to provision the infrastructure, bolt deploys and does the first puppet applies we need then the agent runs continuously to keep the configuration in spec(when we aren't just blue+green blowing things away).

I really like Puppet too and most of the time people say they don't like it vs Ansible it comes down to ""Ansible is easy"" and ""Puppet is arcane"".  Both are true statements IMO.  And something having a lower barrier to entry is actually a Pro in its favor.  Puppet deserves a chance because there are certain things it does really well.

- It won't do anything unless it can compile the whole catalog without issue(won't deploy half your code and then fail).
- Puppet iterators and conditionals work more like traditional C style languages(Ruby in this case) and that works better for me.
- Puppet works most like a traditional programming language while still being declarative.  
- PuppetDB is super useful.

Either is a fine tool - but I fear Ansible is going to take over so much that Puppet dwindles away.  We'll see.  Nobody should be married to any technology tool because they come and go as fast as the wind."
