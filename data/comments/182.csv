Me: I don't understand how to (feature) in (library).

Response: (Library) isn't really the best way to accomplish (feature). You should really use (other library) to accomplish (feature). Here's a code example using (other library).

Me: Well, that's damned great and all, but (other library) isn't present in my company's project's third-party libs, and would require a full security audit before adding. Meanwhile, I found the solution to doing (feature) in (library) and it works just fine and is only slightly more verbose/slow/ugly than your solution, so I'm going that way.

Even better when someone is asking how to accomplish a task in the native version of a programming language and someone suggests installing a third-party package to accomplish it, without giving the native solution. Oh, great. Now my project requires either redistribution of someone else's code (potential license issues) OR it requires a dependency installation every time someone tries to use my project.

That said, it's hard to maintain that level of competence, and different for every language. Used to be I could glance at gcc C++ template errors and know what was wrong.

That is certainly not the same as ""unskilled"". (I don't even believe in ""unskilled jobs""). Rather, it's a job where, doing the job is essentially a matter of learning skills and using them.     

Non-vocational skills or fields are ones where you learn theories or concepts, in addition to skills, and you have to apply creativity and critical thinking to solve problems that don't have a known solution.

  \- The Boolean false, if $string does not contains $findme.  
So let's look at a few cases:  
`strpos(""Hello World"", ""Hello"")` Will returns 0 (the index of the first letter) this will evaluate to false but not to === false (as it is not a Boolean).  
`strpos(""Hello World"", ""World"")` Will return 6, this will evalute to true but not === true.  
`strpos(""Hello World"", ""42"")` Will return the Boolean false, this will evalute to false and ===  false.

Another one I had once was when I was trying to make something respawn in a game I'm making. Everything I saw pointed to using a coroutine. So I researched them and implemented one in the controller for what I wanted to respawn. It still didn't work. Eventually I figured out why.

If you thought to yourself that it's because I was destroying the instance of the object calling the routine you'd be correct. By having it in the same class controlling the existence of the object, including the destruction of it, I was calling the routine but as soon as I called destroy on the object I also destroyed the coroutine.

It's funny how often I find going back to wizards and magic to be apt metaphors, but it fits. Every time you use an abstraction, you gain power, but at the cost of trusting it does what you think. The cost is learning, but as you point out, not everyone is willing to pay it.

You don't NEED to know it, but you'll to be a lot more effective if you have a mental model of what a CPU does, particularly as it relates to caches, threading, and interrupts. Those concerns underpin why things work the way they do and what limitations they have, and it echoes through the whole stack, no matter how high in abstraction that stack goes.

But regardless, every programmer should at least understand things one level of abstraction under the one they work at. Maybe that's not hardware, and it's the JVM instead, but there's always a thing underneath that is responsible for most of the behavior at your level."

For sure. You don't necessarily need to know how much time it takes to access storage or poll a device or deal with network latency or how different data structures or algorithms work but I would say it certainly helps to write good code."

Exactly. It's basically situations like:

""How do I clamp this piece of wood into a vice firmly enough so that I can cut it with my hacksaw, but without leaving marks on the wood.""

and getting the response

""If you're concerned about marks, you should really be using a power saw, since there's less force transferred to the wood, so you don't need to clamp it as hard.""

...Great. I'm not buying a power saw, though. How in the heck do I clamp it to cut it with my hand saw? Sure, maybe 5% of the time someone goes ""Oh, I really should get a power saw"" and goes out and buys one, but 95% of the time it's just not useful. Even in that 5% of the time, they'd have to come back and ask that same exact question, but asking about a power saw instead!"
