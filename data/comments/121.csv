For a similar reason Google is maintaining an internal Linux distribution. If your company is already maintaining / patching Linux servers, it should also be possible to maintain workstations.

One question is, why is your IT department strongly against it, while you're running your PoC - were there any issues?

3,llothar,1558039716.0,192.0,"I don't want to discourage youm but I think your points are pretty weak.

No 1. is very weak. Give us Linux because we like Linux. You claim that it will attract people - this is just not realistic. I'd put that point further down the line as ""boosting morale"" sort of thing.

No.2 is very good. Specific point. Try to find issues that could have been avoided if only developers had easy access to full Linux experience. Developing for Linux without using it is like designing tampons by a strictly male team. This is honestly the only strong point here.

No.3 Hardware cost is tiny compared to total expenditure per person. Valid, but not very strong point.

No.4. same as above.

No.5. Is a no-no! Why do you have IT team? So your developers can focus on what they do best - developing. It is the same reason why your developers should not renovate the building. Personal experience - Engineers were allowed to build their own computers. Two weeks wasted.

To be more constructive, additional thoughts:

- saved license cost can be transferred towards training IT. 10 000 Eur saved is not much. 10 000 Eur to spend is a lot. If you show balance as zero - it looks much better. You solve the issue of IT now being familiar with Linux without added cost.

- Security. Even big companies get attacked by Cryptolockers. Linux should help with that. https://www.wsj.com/articles/norsk-hydro-hit-by-extensive-cyberattack-11553004589"
4,Visticous,1558039565.0,41.0,"I would ad vendor neutrality to the mix: Many companies can develop and support Linux. Only one can develop and support Windows. 

That means that if Linux-partner-X disappoints, you can go to Linux-partner-Y. Ubuntu, Red Het, Suse. You can pick. If Windows' support disappoints, what will you do? 

I work for a German company who is currently in big political trouble because their entire product is build around somebody else his proprietary system... And the relation turned sour. They got nowhere else to go, so they are stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

If your company wants to ensure long term business continuity, it cannot be solely dependent on two (Apple and Microsoft) American duopolists. You should support Linux, not because everybody will use it today, but because it's your escape plan for future scenarios."

I suggest you coldly look at the negatives.  You don't want to be the guy who suggested that the company do something that eventually went very badly.

If you enumerate and examine all the downside you can find, then you're capping the risk, which helps them enormously to understand how it fits in with their picture, and then not only can the risk be managed, if any of those bad things do happen, then they won't be a nasty surprise that badly reflects on the experience."

I've run (Gentoo) Linux at my last four jobs.  The first three were lawless startups but the current job is a more sizeable org with IT support staff.  In all cases the deal was ""you can do it but you're on your own to support it"".  A few other folks run Linux, a variety of distros, and we try to support each other.  I'm still required to, e.g., encrypt the hard drive and update my system, but it's not enforced (honor system).

People usually know if they're ready for the challenge and willing to sacrifice functionality but not always.  Recently a dev proudly traded his Macbook for a linux laptop, only to return to the Macbook a few weeks later because he couldn't get his thunderbolt monitor set up and this was a dealbreaker for him.

This software:

* videoconferencing
* VPN clients 

... tends to be the most proprietary and least likely to work.  Especially for videoconferencing, if your vendor supports Linux at all it may be only one distro via a brittle browser plugin.  I run a Windows VM just for this and the experience is poor.

If all you have are windows machines then  malware targeting windows would be more damaging than if your eco system includes Windows, GNU/Linux and OSX since malware generally is platform specific.

It's true that adding OSX to your eco system will add some diversity but Mac hardware is expensive so the majority will still be Windows.

GNU/Linux is cheaper than Windows so having it also should be a cheaper way to increase diversity.

The other question is what tools do your tech teams use? Many dev environment s are cross platform, and if they're using things like Cygwin or the Windows Linux Subsystem to access any Linux utils then there's an argument to be made that they're ready using Linux specific utils."

Erm. It should probably be pointed out that the current situation is not ""we just have to secure windows,"" but ""many employees are running completely unmanaged linux installations in addition to their windows installs."" So unless security wants to create a massive change in everybody's workflow (good luck to them), they should be happy that the employees are willing to switch to a single linux distro and at least play ball with them (hey, maybe you could host your own repos so you don' have to have everyone downloading their software from the public internet)."

It is certainly possible to use linux on desktops in an organisation (i've done it), but it isn't approached lightly, and you definitely don't want to be taking ideas from home linux users about the complexities involved in a project of that magnitude. The fact your central IT have washed their hands of the idea should be setting off your alarm bells.

The employee is even free to completely reinstall their own favorite Linux distro if they choose. This has worked out quite well, especially since web applications are so common in the corporate world, and Linux has fantastic browser support. Of course there are email clients with integrated calendars, and all the same paradigms of an office suite of software. Libre office just works, and there are things like Google docs or Microsoft Office 360 or whatever, web applications.

30,zuzuzzzip,1558042144.0,2.0,"FWIW I run Fedora Workstation on my laptop and so do a few others for the same reasons as OP.

The main problem is central management and security, I bet.  

While I need to support the OS myself, I am compliant in the sense that:  
* my drive is encrypted  
* I run our corporate AV client with central management (BitDefender)  
* I run our corporate local IDS/firewall which is centtrally managed (CrowdStrike Falcon)  
* my screen auto-locks after x time

So it depends what tools you use within the company, but central management is usually the problem.

As others mentioned, you could use RH Sattelite (or the free upstream Foreman) to manage all the clients, and even have security compliance reports come in using OpenSCAP.  


You could also set it up in a way that you can auto-remediate using Ansible playbooks.  
This last thing requires proper access to the machine, though. So you would probably need to create an image or even betrer a centrally managed PXE environment with kickstart templates (very easy to do with Foreman).  

You can of course join these machines to the AD domain and have the benefits of being a Kerberos client. Although I would recommend setting up a FreeIPA environment for these clients (and your servers) these days."

i am lucky enough to get to run linux on my work machine because it suits my job and the IT department and higher-ups have placed trust in me. if i were to violate that trust by being out-of-pocket for any period of time due to issues i caused myself or couldn't fix, i would be out of a job. is that level of responsibility ON TOP of daily tasks something your developers are really up for?"

35,Savet,1558048629.0,2.0,"The only real answer to this is because your company values employee engagement and you want to provide powerful tools to top talent. There are very few use cases that require one os over another and those few use cases are generally focused on Windows development or iOS development.

But that being said, there are platforms that allow people to be more productive. For example, java development for apps targeted at jboss or weblogic? It's a lot easier to change to change your jdk on Linux and you can spin up a dev instance of jboss or weblogic without admin rights. It's also a lot easier to develop on a platform that is more similar to the deployment environment. If i had a nickel for every time I've heard ""it worked on my machine"" I'd have a lot of nickels.

My company is huge and you have heard of it. We were losing top UI development talent because we tried to force them to use Windows as a dev platform.

Linux is Linux.  There's also muscle memory.  If your desktop is Linux, you will get better at Linux in the server room too.

3. **you'll save money on hardware**.  More so than that, I've found that I can generally get by with half as much hardware with Linux as I can with Windows.  Linux is so much more efficient, depending on the DE.

4, 6. **possibly saving some license costs**.  I think  this is le$$ compelling for corporations, except for maybe small companies.

>I need to make also the Security team happy... they want a way to check ... the OS is correctly patched and what packages are currently installed.

In regards to security:

* SELinux is great for security.  Another reason to use Fedora.
* There's never been a major, widespread virus on Linux.  Get cyber out of the AV mindset.
* Allow users to install what they want, but only allow approved repositories.
* It's easy to configure Fedora to automatically install security updates.
* Create a Fedora kickstart to automate and homogenize desktop setup.
* Run a security scanner, like Lynis, to help you harden your default setup.

&#x200B;

In regards to support:

Anything different can be scary.  If IT is used to Windows, Linux will seem alien and difficult to work with.  However, Linux is generally easier to support, IMO.  You may experience more problems with Linux, but they are easier to diagnose and fix, and fixes are easier to automate and distribute.

39,Optica1,1558092939.0,2.0,"Some thoughts:

- For security: any Linux computer can be controlled the same way as a server. So to check the security you can add the laptops to config management (ansible, puppet,...) This also makes it easy to install new software on machines. With apt-mirror you can host your own repository for software compatibility. (There's probably a yum equivalent for this.)

- I think the biggest issue is software compatibility. You have to make clear to users that choosing Linux won't allow them to have Microsoft office, Adobe,...

- the Linux desktop has really matured. You don't have to know command line anymore to use a system.

- the Ubuntu forums never failed to give an answer, often with pictures and howtos. Teach your users to use these wiki's.

- in my experience, Linux is a lot more stable if you pick LTS versions and software from the apt repos. This should lower helpdesk calls. For example: My parents, grandparents were all on Ubuntu 14.04. I never heard them and a couple months ago I upgraded them to 18.04. never heard of them in between... However they just use a browser, some documents and thunderbird.

- people often complain about their laptop becoming slower. Without serious cleanups on a Windows laptop every year, it really slows down a lot. On Linux/mac this problem never occured (in my experience).

- when there are serious issues, you can easily reinstall the OS if you keep a separate home partition. Also the reinstallation process of Linux is a lot faster than windows and Mac.

- you don't have to pay for overpriced Apple computers.

- a lot of applications are web based nowadays. So people often have many browser tabs open. Linux is conservative on killing browser tabs so people with low ram often experience lag. Make sure there is enough swap space. 
On 4GB ram laptops, I put a swap file of 10GB. People now open 50 tabs without issues. Standard Ubuntu install creates a swap file of 2GB which is way too small IMO."

There are cons to Windows that you've mentioned, but I think you're arguing on the wrong points.

* License costs - arguing on this alone isn't effective for businesses. Most big companies (like yours sounds like) won't give a shit about license costs. They're pissing away probably 3k already on this meeting coming up on man-hours alone.
* Closed source, but most people don't give a shit.
* Personal preference. My company's policy is ""deal with it"". Personal preference isn't enough to warrant just changing our infrastructure. I can't argue on that.

&#x200B;

And there are pros to Windows, we have to be honest. The main pro for Windows is that it has taken over the world. Therefore, most infrastructure is available for it. This includes, but is not limited to...

\- Windows is the base OS for almost any laptop - the exceptions being Chromebooks (lol) and Macs. This means no up-front installation is required by your team.

\- There is more commercial ""IT"" software available for Windows and software like ""Team Viewer"", which makes remote IT support easy in Windows.

\- More people are likely familiar with it already.

&#x200B;

But each of these has a good counter

* It is easy to install a new OS no-problem, and your IT team will get good at it VERY quickly. This is a non-issue.
* While there isn't much (in my experience) ""enterprise"" IT support software for Linux computers, you also don't really need it.
   * You don't need a ""drive-mounting"" program for Linux - you have mount and /etc/fstab .
   * You don't need ""remote-logmein-5000"" for Linux - you have SSH. 
   * Want to create a bootable flash disk on Linux? cp debian.iso /dev/ttyUSB0 or whatever. One command, 3 seconds. Compare that to Rufus.

   * Need to change an ip address? ifconfig interface ipaddr
* Installing new software for Linux computers is fool-proof. IT guy gets a request, he ssh's into the target workstation and runs sudo apt install thing. EZ mode.
   * Compare that to a remote-log in (which basically requires an appointment), or requiring the IT guy to show up at a person's computer with a physical flash drive containing an out of date binary for notepad++. Yeesh. The ssh method can happen without the employee even noticing.
* Windows may be familiar, but once your IT dept is good at Linux, they will be the best IT dept ever because of the high skill-ceiling for Linux machines vs Windows machines.
* And tell your IT guys not to lie to me on this one; there is no such thing as an ""intuitive"" computer. When you don't know something, you google it. Always. Linux, Mac, Windows, whatever. Your IT department does a LOT of googling.

&#x200B;

But the best long-term arguments I would give your company to (at a minimum) support multiple workstations is this.

* Modularity / agnosticism. Your company should allow employees to use multiple systems because then it's easier not to become too dependent on any of them.
   * This will drive more web-app focused corporate tools, which means that it's easier for your company to swap out tools if the developers / companies behind them become inexplicably stupid / evil (Looking at you, Microsoft)
* It allows your team exposure to new tools and ways of thinking. Do you \*really\* need office? I mean, right now, yes. But what if your team gets fed up with it? All of a sudden, you have Latex available at your IT guys ""sudo apt install"" fingertips, or you can simply edit text files in a markdown format much more easily with Vi or Emacs.
* I mean, you can be a fuckin wizard on Linux systems. The skill ceiling is near endless. I wrote a tool over this weekend to help my monthly data-entry spending tracking because no tools on the market were for me. Took me a day. Ez-mode.
* Imagine a world where the data entry girl doesn't need to spend 8 hours OT copying and pasting the same document format over 20 deliverables. She now has a tool at her disposal to automate that no problem.

&#x200B;

And there are big corporate plus points for Linux as well.

* The big distros support ~~grandma~~ user-friendly desktop environments.
* Full disk encryption out of the box - Just tick the box at install in Ubuntu.
* 2 factor authentication is supported with google-authenticator. Took me 5 seconds to find out how to set that up.

&#x200B;

But the biggest pro for using a Linux system on a regular basis (and a strong enough argument on its own for the entire world to use it) is how easy and safe it is to install new software.

* Linux distros come configured to point at trusted repositories for their software. This allows new software to be installed in one step; sudo apt install sofware. 
* Compare that to Windows, where you navigate to some janky site, dodge porn ads, avoid the popup, untick the box for the chinese ""download manager"", wait for bitfly, and then click past the malware warning because some guy on reddit said that we should ignore that but no really.

&#x200B;

.....um im not sure how to answer this.



All of you arguments are from a dev point of view that has your workflow. You never bothered to ask IT about what they do or set up on your machines that isn't dev related. You never asked them what the per user licensing cost is. You state opposition from IT when honestly you don't understand what they do. You are also assuming macs will be allowed everywhere because of a small subset of users have macs. Your IT staff needs infrastructure to manage pc's. A vast majority of software exists for windows and macs. There is some linux. The problem is your IT does not have the know how for linux which means hiring people. I have looked into what you are doing, and it is only cost effective if your IT staff has the tools and knowledge base. I worked at a windows shop where sales hired a graphic artist who insisted on a mac even though all the software she used had a wimdows version. The IT manager asked me what we could do to ease the burden of support. I told him to have the sales mamager sign off that any extra support for this one person will come out of his budget because it was going to be expensive. The IT staff had to deal with so many issues because she refuses to accomodate anything with windows that IT literally showed that they were spemding 3 hours a day supporting her complaints and issues for the first year. Sales manager was not happy and even argued over his budget because he wasnt going to be able to upgrade his staff's equipment for another year. CTO pretty much told him to deal with it because he was warned and IT literally had to handle a one off.

You have 10 days. If you want to make a convincomg argument on the topic then you will have to ask IT for the following:

* average support cost of a windows user currently
* average support cost of a mac user at the beginning of when they started supporting macs
* average support cost of a mac user now and how long it took them to get there
* "" it doesn't just work like it does on GNU/Linux (their words, not mine)"" is a bs argument, especially when a lot of documentation about setting it up on windows pretty much indicates a small difference in setup that could be done voa script. What doesn't behave the same? What was done for root cause analysis on this?
* vm performance is poor. How so? 5%? 20%? You need metrics so you can convert said metric to lost time in work. For example, operation X on a real machine takes 2 hours but on my machine it is 2 hours and 5 minutes. Operation X is done once a day. Thats 25 minutes a week which over a year translates to a little under 22 hours. Will the extra development time make up the support costs?
* what is the cost difference for ordering a linux box vs a windows box vs a mac?
* does IT's current asset solution also handle linux? If not what was the research time and cost for their current solution.
* what is the licensing cost difference between a mac and windows?

You currently have no arguments other than ""devs will be happier"" but no numbers behind how much they would save. The bottom line is what matters. The fact that they are open to it means that they may be willing to invest if it makes developers more efficient and costs increases are minimal."

Security involved both physical (locking doors etc) to making sure programs are scanned and audited before being allowed to run on the network.
2. Why? WSL works exactly like Linux, they are simply lying. The number of incompatible programs with WSL is a handful of reported programs last time I bothered checking the list. It works perfectly fine. Also unless you are doing something like Linux kernel development I suspect that most of the languages / libraries you are using work fine cross platform.

&#x200B;

The security team is probably never going to be happy, and neither is the license management team. The desktop support team is probably closely aligned with the license management team, and they probably justify headcount based on how many systems they manage.... right? They might say it will cost millions of dollars for them to support another operating system -- so any cost savings you propose could be cut to shreds.

If people are already using Linux internally and doing it themselves... what needs to change? Are they being prevented from installing Linux themselves? Do they get in trouble for removing the ""corporate image""? If yes, then you need to either fly under their radar, or you need to get an executive sponsor. Go for the ""giving people what they want makes them happy and more productive"" angle.  That is simple and true.

If there's no cost or business impact to letting users who want Linux run Linux, why would you stop them? If you get resistance, try to turn the tables and make it the responsibility of the dissenters to defend not letting people run Linux. Does your company let people work from home on their own computers? Does IT manage home computers and support the users on them? Does your IT manage people's mobile phones?

This is your #1 reason, especially if your company has enough highly-paid people (e.g. developers) who want this. Would this company even consider skimping on hardware? Like, would it be so stupid as to put hard drives in developer machines, instead of SSDs, or to make developers jump through hoops to get a second monitor? Then why skimp on software?

For this, I think Steve Yegge has [a great rant](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/04/settling-osx-focus-follows-mouse-debate.html) that mirrors my experience working with other OSes:

> Given that I switched quite recently to the Mac, I'm still reeling from the lack of focus-follows-mouse behavior. To help you put yourself in my shoes, imagine that your latest operating system upgrade (whatever OS you happen to be running) includes a new mandatory feature wherein each time you click on a window to focus it, a loud alarm goes off (""BLONK! BLONK! BLONK! ..."") and you have to open the System menu and select ""silence window alarm"" to shut it up.

> That's what not having autofocus is like to people who've been using it for the past 10 to 30 years (in my case, 20 years). BLONK! BLONK! BLONK! I'm serious. It's that bad. Not exaggerating even a tiny bit.

And that's just one of *many* aspects of the desktop UI that Linux lets you customize, while Windows and OS X don't. Many of the best Linux developers have one thing or another about the Linux UI that they've gotten accustomed to over the years. Some people like tiling window managers, some like focus-follows-mouse, some like scripting their entire UI and carrying around a batch of custom keyboard shortcuts.

I'd argue this isn't just about being more productive, either. It's also about attracting and retaining top talent. If I were working at that company, pretty much any company that allows Linux on the desktop would find it easy to hire me away. (In fact, if I were in your shoes, I'd be looking already.)

> I got this answer from several colleagues. Some are very frustrated when they try to use Docker on Windows, even with the Windows Subsystem For Linux, because it doesn't just work like it does on GNU/Linux (their words, not mine). And yes, they can use VMs, but sadly the performances are not the same as running on the host OS (big frustration point).

Unfortunately for this argument [Microsoft is actively working on fixing all of that](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/shipping-a-linux-kernel-with-windows/). Yes, ultimately that means VMs, so maybe the performance will actually be subpar in some important way... maybe. And even if it is, Microsoft could still win the argument by being cheaper and Good Enough.

It's worth bringing up if you can find good, solid examples, or benchmarks that show where Linux-in-a-VM is actually slow, but otherwise, it's not really obvious why Linux-on-baremetal is better than Linux-on-Windows.

> This means buying dozens, if not hundreds, of expensive Mac Book Pro instead of cheaper and easily upgradeable Dell notebooks. It will also be easier to convert a GNU/Linux notebook into a Windows one and the other way around if, for some reason, someone is not happy with their choice.

Also seems unlikely to be persuasive. Like I said earlier, developers are expensive, so saving a few pennies on developer hardware shouldn't be a big deal. Heck, give people desktops *and* laptops -- I wouldn't mind a Mac so much if I only had to use it as a laptop during meetings, ssh-ing back into my desktop for any real work.

Same for the licenses -- even if they don't just have some blanket company-wide license, it's not likely to be a ton of money per-developer, especially compared to support costs.

Plus, what's hard about putting Windows on a Macbook?

> a) if Helpdesk doesn't want to do it, an external partner could provide support. In opposition to the Windows world, where you can deal only with one partner for support,

Not actually true. MS may be the only ones who can dig into the code and fix it, but you can certainly get *helpdesk*-level support from multiple vendors.

> on the GNU/Linux world there are plenty of partners that would love to offer their support, like Canonical or Suse. b) if Helpdesk doesn't want to do it, the community can provide support.

These are okay points, but not a substitute for actually getting IT buy-in.

Linux is easiest to support with a you-break-it-you-buy-it model. As in, helpdesk wouldn't need to support every Linux configuration under the sun, only a few blessed ones -- you'll pick a DE (GNOME? KDE? Cinnamon? One of those) to be the officially-supported one.

One downside of Linux is lack of proper built in central management including login accounts and authentication.  Yeah you can script stuff or setup really complicated setups where it goes against defaults using 3rd party stuff, but most IT people don't really want to homebrew a bunch of scripts or configure really complex stuff to do things that are turn key in Windows. Whatever steps are involved need to be repeated on every single workstation.  In a windows environment you have AD, as well as various deployment tools and it's only a few clicks to join a domain and then everything works.  

Also NTFS is superior to Linux's permission system.  Users ask for the most whacked permission schemes sometimes and you need to be able to provide that. A simple user, group, global is just not going to cut it.  Karen needs to be able to list files in folder A, create/edit, but not be able to delete, John however needs full read/write access to the same folder. Dave needs read only access, but to be allowed to create folders, and only folders.  Good luck doing that with Linux's permission system.   Also in Linux permissions there's no inheritance, so every file has it's own permissions and it can become a mess. 

I would love to see Linux in an enterprise environment myself but after actually doing IT, it's sadly just not suited for it for those reasons and others alone.  Sure there may be some stuff you can do with Samba to join a domain, and use other management tools etc, but these are all extra steps you have to do on every single PC and won't be turn key. Some of them are very tedius like having to setup LDAP and Kerberos etc.   It's great for servers like local intranet servers, etc or other dedicated tasks but for workstations Windows is just so much easier to manage, even with it's annoyances. Everything is turn key once you get past the blue screens of death.  

That said, if this is an environment where desktop management is not a big deal because everything is web based and users manage their own local workstations, then I say go for it.  The savings in licensing costs alone makes it worth it.  Windows is freaking expensive in an enterprise environment, especially once you start to introduce things like Office, Exchange etc.  Everything is per PC and per user, I always found that licensing model absurd.   Add Citrix to the mix and now you're basically paying 3+ times for everything.  Citrix license per user, (and per server I think), Windows license per user, (the remote session requires a separate license on top of local workstation!) and finally a license for the software itself that's being launched via citrix.

82,TwoDeuces,1558071792.0,1.0,"Honestly, I think the correct answer is that Linux isn't fine for corporate use UNLESS you have an IT support system that is capable of supporting the platform.  
  
All enterprises today should be moving, maybe not precisely towards a zero-trust security policy, but at the very least incorporating parts of zero-trust. Things like automatic & enforced 1st and 3rd party patching, endpoint detection and response/forensics tool sets, policy based full-disk encryption, etc, etc.  
  
If your company can't provide this same suite of tools to your Linux clients, then those clients are a liability and shouldn't be allowed access to corporate resources. End of story.  
  
You counter this by saying that you can outsource Linux support. For one thing, I'm certain that would erase any savings you think you might get on OS licensing. For another, Linux support is severely lacking when it comes to security tools. Best case scenario, your outsourced company wouldn't just have to provide operational ""break/fix"" support, but would also need to stand up the tools necessary to secure your linux endpoints.  
  
If I was in my current role at your company I would say no."
83,FruityWelsh,1558072428.0,1.0,"My advice on it all just keep a good image and re image the box (this could be down remotely (like kickstart for redhat) or by just swapping drives) if something goes wrong, and have a good backup policy for user data (not local ideally).

Focus on troubleshooting common problems (like ones associated to your gold image). If the world isn't burning then your IT guys can learn Linux with people having minor issues with their custom changes.

Don't throw IT under the bus though, but I agree the work comes first and their there to support you guys. If your server guys already have tools they might impress the IT guys too. If you're using AD or LDAP already you can using to manage both the Linux and windows (I assume Mac too, but IDK). In terms of giving ""admin access"" I wouldn't personally.

85,wpm,1558073218.0,1.0,"Hi there,

So, as a bit of a background, I work in a central IT department that is technically classified to deal with high-risk data, and I'm an endpoint manager, meaning I'm ""OfficeIT"" in your case. 

At our org, we offer both Windows and Mac as choices for staff machines. While IBM figures they save $500 over the lifetime of a Mac versus a Windows PC (including licenses and FTE time), IBM also has the money to throw at specialized solutions for each platform to make that happen. And I will say, as a primarily Mac centric employee, I think they're a superior work device both from a management point of view and from a developer point of view. Maybe you wouldn't buy one yourself, but with DEP and a proper MDM, deloyment and management is easy as piss and the OS is rock-solid (hardware...meh, we've been lucky with the keyboard issues on the MBPs so far). Linus is cool and all, but I much prefer to just spin up a CentOS VM in our datacenter, or locally through VMWare Fusion than actually work in it all day. Almost every single one of our devs uses a Mac, managed by me with Jamf, and it honestly takes up a very small amount of my time. It takes me the same amount of time to deploy a single Macbook as it does an order of 500 iMacs, which is to say, about 2 minutes of clicking. 

But what I can say is this. IT Security is a hybrid of both IT and HR. I can do my best to secure my fleet of Macs, ensure they're up to date, encrypted, and so on, but ultimately, I'm handing over a computer to someone. If they have physical, day to day access, I assume that people will try and succeed in breaking shit, or doing things that are against policy. My job isn't to herd those cats, or be the police. I hand out managed tools to make people's jobs easier, and if they break them, then they have to answer for it, not me.

Ultimately, the only thing I'd care about as far as Linux endpoints go is reporting. I'd want to know exactly what is installed, how it was installed, what the state of specific security policy compliance issues are (full disk encryption, desktop backups, password policies and LDAP configs). We recently had one developer who used Linux on his endpoint, and basically, we told him, we don't have the man-power or money to boot-strap a Linux management service, so you're on your own. Here is IT security policy, you need to be logging in with your LDAP creds, backup your shit with this software, encrypt your disk, and don't be stupid. Linux users are just de facto going to be more technical than your average graphic designer or accountant, they can probably easily handle these tasks on their own, and helpdesk calls are going to likely be zero, they'll try and fix everything themselves. 

So, I'd look into proper endpoint reporting, so when someone forgets their laptop at a coffee shop, OfficeIT can cover their asses and say ""look, it checked into our reporting server an hour before it went missing, and it is listed as encrypted, and backed up, so the company's data is safe"", and then HR/purchasing can deal with the employee for losing equipment (which is small fry to losing potentially protected data). After that, everything else is an HR problem. Draw up proper acceptable use policies and basically say that ""If you're going to use a Linux machine, we'll buy you one, and maybe set it up, but maintaining things, helpdesk stuff, all that, is on **you**"".

Or, more easily, without having to make this a political fight, simply tell OfficeIT that they can force Windows on everyone, but they need to purchase and deploy proper enterprise grade hypervisor applications to everyone's machines so that devs can have a proper dev environment to do their jobs in. Honestly, VMs are so so much easier than bare-metal anyways, because you can break shit all you want and just revert to snapshot."

* Has many good options for centralized management.
* Very easy to mass deploy, just clone an original machine, then allow the package manager to update everything and you are ready to go. All this can be streamlined to a ""insert USB drive, power on, wait"". Similar things can be done with Windows, but is more work, more complicated and takes more time.
* Separation of user data and everything else, which means that if a machine should go strange, just wipe it, re-clone, update and put in the old user data, and the user should have ""his own"" machine back, with all settings. The helpdesk will like this, basically, a single script can do it all. Windows can't do this at all, a new install is raw, you have to redo all your settings, for all your programs.
* Strict policies can be set. It's possible, through centralized management, to set exactly what each user can, and cannot do. Windows is very weak in this regard.
* For developers, it's important to match target environments. I've done cross platform dev, and it never works well, despite what the dev tool company promises. You always run into strange stuff. Virtual machines help a little, but some strange things remain.
* For devs, it has powerful scripting capabilities, which makes it easy to automate many processes, such as building and unit testing. Can be done in Windows, but that's like saying ""I can dig with a spoon as good as an excavator"".
* It's an emergent technology. More and more customers are using Linux, especially on the server side, but also in automation and situations where ""failure is not an option"". The customers will want to know that you walk the walk, not just talk the talk. There are way too many companies who send someone to a class for a week, then sell them as ""experts"", and the customers know this. If you can say ""Well, 60% of our developers works on Linux every day, by their own choice"", the customers will KNOW that not only do they have real experience, they have something more important: a burning personal interest in the platform, and you'll have the customer hook, line and sinker.
* License costs. Don't underestimate how much license costs can build up for a large organization. Typically, the license costs for a typical Windows machine in an office setting is more than the cost of the machine, and for a developer, it can easily run up to 3-5 times the cost of the hardware (even if you count the more expensive hardware of a dev machine). Many of the licenses today are also not ""buy once and be done with it"", it's ""pay a fee every year"".
* Guaranteed costs. You know that license fees won't suddenly skyrocket, as GPL just makes someone else take up the torch and continue with a free product. Say, for example, if Apple were to go out of business, what would happen to Windows license costs then?
* A penguin is cuter than Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Seriously, if you anticipate a antagonistic mood at the presentation, bring this up as a point, with illustrative images, just to get a chuckle out of the audience and set a positive mood."

We had that happen in a very high-end facility using regular HDMI cables. The working theory is that they started disappearing when someone took one or two offsite (for sales) and never returned them, but the rest disappeared because hoarding them was the only way to ensure a cable was available after that point.

I've seen a similar thing happen with computer mice and with laptop power supplies. The things that disappear aren't particularly expensive, they're the items that someone wants on short notice. But if you let there become any kind of a persistent shortage, you'll find more and more disappearing into locked drawers as people hoard them.

That's why I always recommend that institutional purchasers buy and issue two power supplies for each laptop, so that the user can leave one at home and one in the office. You're saving time and money by doing it up front instead of when they go missing or get ""lost"", and everyone's happier and more productive.

Another factor is that good developers are hard to find and many of them, like me, have the luxury to say no to jobs where I would need to work with tools which I do not like.

The reality is Linux is going to cost your organisation more than Windows. So I'll add some points to /u/vermyx that might help you form some good approaches to getting this across the board.

&#x200B;

1. Licensing costs are basically nothing. Your wage for 1 hour would more than cover the monthly licensing costs for a Windows machine + Office. 
2. With Linux you will need a support contract from a vendor. So you'd be stuck with RHEL, SuSe, Ubuntu etc. Don't try to push an unsupported distro; businesses want assurances that if you leave they can ring someone to help them. This also ensures the business can have experts on call or available to contract if necessary from the vendor. Many organisations will use Microsoft services as part of their contracts when doing upgrades etc.
3. It's a great opportunity for your organisation to invest in training/professional development for their staff making them more versatile. The skills they learn can allow staff to better work across teams (e.g. Windows and Linux guys in the same team working together).
4. Find ways to show how Linux can integrate into the existing environment to help operations/security/compliance. Linux can be configured to use Active Directory so you should be talking to your Ops team about how this works so they can understand it and be comfortable. If you use cloud file storage like GDrive, OneDrive.. show how this can work with your Distro.
5. Provide a solution with costings for patching the systems and deploying software. Try to work with Ops to come up with a high level concept that they will back. Bring security in for the conversation to get their blessing. 
6. Consider how asset management is done. Figure out who does it now and how. Will your Linux solution work with their current processes/tools?
7. Check with your Legal/Regulatory/Compliance teams to see if there is anything special you need to consider. If there isn't, make sure you raise this as something you've considered.

&#x200B;

All n all, the business is looking for you to come with answers/solutions and an idea of the costs/benefits. If you play the philosophical game (cost/licensing/GNU/FOSS) you will lose. Linux will cost more than Windows, Microsoft have built an entire ecosystem around Windows that is easy to use and does MANY MANY things (Azure, Exchange, Office, Malware Protection, Active Directory etc). Linux is just an Operating System, so you need to fill in the gaps in some way."
190,Han-ChewieSexyFanfic,1558076119.0,5.0,"> Why should employees get to choose their own OS? It isn't their computer, it isn't their business.

Because the competition allows them, and all other things being equal, a developer will prefer to work where they can use their OS of preference as their daily driver."
191,ChrisTX4,1558091375.0,2.0,"> WSL works exactly like Linux, they are simply lying.

There's quite significant differences.

1. WSL has no support for GUI. You can get a local X11 server installed on Windows (e.g. VcXsrv or X410), but there's no graphical acceleration and Qt5 apps currently do not work unless you strip the .note.ABI section from them.

2. WSL's file I/O handles quite differently. It's slow as hell, especially if you keep Windows Defender or any other AV enabled, and compiling, say GCC, takes ages due to this. Moreover, the Windows access system is leaking into WSL; you can't delete a folder you've currently cd'd into for example. This can break scripts, and I've seen precisely that happening.

3. There's no systemd whatsoever, and no dbus running.

4. A complete lack of cgroups, SELinux, AppArmor, … make it behave different as to when deploying on actual Linux. Not to mention you can't use anything that requires an actual Linux kernel to be present, say using OProfile (or Intel VTune).

5. The kernel API is in a lot of ways lacking behind, there's a number of APIs missing (e.g. SysV IPC) and others behave differently.

6. All that aside, there's a handful of Linux distros supported for WSL, and RHEL isn't one of them. RHEL defaults to SELinux, uses different paths or software versions than say Ubuntu.

If you deploy to Linux, WSL can be a very useful tool, but that's about it. It doesn't support services or the likes for good reason - it's a tool to ease development and bridge Windows and Linux, not to eliminate or replace Linux. Using WSL to test for production is not a good idea."

They are both neutral afaik: Security just want to be able to do audits on the machines and check if they are correctly patched and what is installed. License management has already approved Fedora for the Linux POC and Ubuntu 18.04 for the Windows Subsystem For Linux on Windows 10.

Flying under the radar is not an option: you need a certificate to connect to the intranet via both ethernet and wifi and, frankly, I don't think would be a professional thing to do to do it this way. And if something bad would happens, I don't even want to think what the consequences could be..."

It all depends on which part you find more important. Personally, I could give a shit what kernel I use. I choose a GNU/Linux system because I want the GNU like a fat kid wants another scoop of ice cream.

If that means re-training, great. If that means hiring more talent with the required experience, great.

If close to 40% of their clients are switching to an OS they choose not to support, they should also lose a similar amount of resources. Their job load just got significantly lightened.

For the office IT, it could be a chance for them to learn something new and acquire new skills. Also, if they have less Windows machines to support, there, their workload could go down. Especially if combined with your idea of a community support site, and if you can get support from the security teams on the management, this could actually help to make the workload on the Office IT go down.

Develop a meaningful metric, like Tickets raised with criticality medium to high no higher than 10% above Windows' level plus no high critically ticket open for longer than one week. You'll figure it out. 

What happens if pilot fails? Back to Windows at zero cost-license is already there assigned to the laptop."
231,jorge1209,1558042628.0,4.0,"I have to agree with llothar. I think you should ditch the plan to replace your laptop with Linux and instead ask for a pilot program to support virtualized Linux on developer machines or ask for a secondary personal dev box.

At only 1000 employees your firm isn't that large and unless a massive fraction of employees wanted Linux it wouldn't be cost effective to focus on making Linux a first class system at the firm.

Instead you want your #2 point to guide things. You will be a more effective employee of you can use tooling that is more in line with production systems. You can access those tools either with a modest investment in hardware (a single laptop lease is a small fraction of an FTE cost), or some free virtualisation.

It can be auxiliary and not risk any negative impact on your performance because you can always fall back to what you already have, and if it does work, then you will be more effective. In other words you will still have Outlook and Skype and won't miss any meetings. People can still send you excel documents and expect you to be able to open them, but you will be able to use emacs and bash."

I don't skip those positions because I'm not able to get my way, but rather because I have absolutely zero faith in the competency of the technical management of the company. Not being able to run the same platform as the product is generally the tip of a very horrible iceberg of dumb decisions."

The thing is in my world there is a similar situation with CAD software.

Just like the ""it doesn't work the same way"" won't be seen as a well thought out argument. 

In this case the company has no infrastructure in supporting said scenario. The responses I put were strictly on why OP had a bad argument because they amounted to a ""we want shiny"" argument from a management perspective. and why I listed items to ask so that he can put more concrete data to better support and make a better argument. I completely understand the tools argument. Personally I am platform agnostic and believe each platform has the pros and cons. As for good developers, this is very subjective. I've met some that would be able to code quickly and come up with good ideas, but their code was harder to understand. I've met some that would be slow in coding but their code was clean, well structured, and  debugable. These two profiles both fit good developers but depending on the kpi used they can both be measured as crap developers.

At the end of the day I want OP to succeed and pointed to data that would help with his arguments as well as potentially create avenues of comminication so that OP can see the other side of the coin."

When a dev wants to ask the business for something, they need to think in business terms and  /[u/leinardi](https://www.reddit.com/user/leinardi/) has not made any points that would be valid. Security, legislation, support, integration, maintenance, cost, compliance are all factors that need to be considered. The reality is, Linux is more expensive than Windows in a corporate environment.

&#x200B;

""Another factor is that good developers are hard to find and many of them, like me, have the luxury to say no to jobs"". This would be true in very very very few places in the world. The truly great developers can work on any platform and typically don't give a shit (a good builder never blames his tools).

That's something a software dev should understand, especially when it comes to Change and Release. The Service Desk and Desktop Team has been recruited for and staffed by people with windows support experience and a bit of dabbling in macos. There may be linux enthusiasts there however it is not the job they signed on for and already spend all day fighting fires on. Enter Linux. Linux is managed differently, supported in a different way. It has a huge learning curve. It's more than Transitioning support for a particular application into the Service Catalogue. It's a a new OS, with different versions of existing applications - Libre Office is the best example OP cited.. not to mention the Linux version of X app, if available. The support staff will need to be trained on how to use all these things as well as simple Linux concepts. While OP opens the odd slideshow or spreadsheet, it doesn't mean it isn't a daily requirement for many. Would you want to receive a call along the lines of ""I'm collaborating with a colleague on windows and when we email the file back and forth making revisions we have formatting issues"" ? The Service Desk would need a budget for training, additional staff as their Service Catalogue just a lot bigger. You think if even 5% of users went to Linux and the Service Desk didn't support it their workload would be lightened? There'd be proxy issues from Windows users having collaboration problems with Linux users. Not to mention printing.. Oy Vey. If the Linux users ended up using browser versions of O365 and Webex then they might as well be on Chrome OS at that point.. and  browser use of existing apps is already in their Service Catalogue. The ROI on reducing Capex/Opex would come slowly with a lot of pain, of ever. I think Linux is great and I hope they get the option.. but it needs to be managed as a project and transitioned in correctly with a LOT of documentation.. not just dumped on the Service Desk.

Microsoft has been happy to encourage that line of thinking for over twenty years now. They deserve any marketshare losses that come from it now.

The truth is that there are no *direct* cost-savings from getting rid of Windows on the desktop in organizations already using it at scale, especially if you're using OEM licenses. The direct cost savings only come from getting rid of the large number of ancillary servers and services that accumulate: AD-DCs, WSUS, MDT, SCCM, Exchange, IIS, RDS/TS, MSSQL, Sharepoint, Lync, and the CALs to go with them. 

I count six types of CALs that a client user/device might need, though Project Server CALs are probably rare, and I've mostly seen Sharepoint CALs tossed in as a bundle. I've heard of Sharepoint CAL prices getting expensive after a enterprise decides to implement it to use the ""free"" bundled licenses, though.

But if you had Windows desktops using OEM licenses that came with the hardware, running a non-Microsoft office suite, using no CALs, no DHCP or DNS, accessing no Windows servers or MSSQL databases, then there's no licensing dollars to be saved by converting those to Linux."

I wish people understood that, especially the cultural 'hipsters' entering some professional environment (whether as employees or that they founded themselves).

In the era of cross-platform and virtualization (all great, awesome things in and of themselves), you still need to test and often write your software on the actual target OS.

I know, revolutionary:

- Linux software on Linux
- Windows software on Windows
- MacOS software on MacOS
- iOS software tested on iOS (and written on MacOS)
- Android software tested on Android (written on any but Linux makes more sense imho)

It doesn't help your company to have one set of platforms in-house and another set for customers targets. Eat your own damn dog food and stop thinking _any_ platform is ""the best"". It's only the best for software that runs on it.

Nailed it. Everything you said below that is just so true.

People tend to lump together the characteristics of startups (of anything really), black-and-white thinking, as if everything about them was bad (or good). The truth is, in the early 2000's, from a managerial / organization stanpoint, startups basically implemented a much saner approach on a human level, by removing *a lot* of unnecessary constrains. Not everything can be generalized to big structures, of course, but some salient elements made their way to mainstream organization by now.

- work hours and remote etc. only matter when there's interaction with others than needs to be synchronous (phone calls, meetings, etc). If people are responsibly delivering on their job, why add artificial time constrains?

- having a pool or video games to relax is arguably better than doing facebook or angry birds on a phone. Besides the impracticality of some of these things in large corporation buildings, I never understood the cultural backlash back then. I think people were just salty, mostly. 

    I remember in the early 2000's I worked at a place (300ish employees, 50 on-site HQ) where the CEO was adamant we had a ""reading room"" with tons of books, magazines, coffee and snacks --- it was in Paris, he was a book lover, he liked antiques too and the building was 200 years olds with beautiful stones, the furniture was oh-so-Classic too... it really was something, that room. Felt like some elite club. You'd never liken that to a startup video game room. Yet it achieved the exact same purpose, and many of us loved it. CEO personally spent ~1K/month to pay for that room's expenses (regardless of annual profit and his bonuses), and brought books himself almost every week, his way of giving back. I never paid for 1 coffee in the 18 months I stayed (and it was damn good coffee too). Oh, btw, the room had been there since 1987. QOL is a thing. Didn't wait for startups.

- choosing your work environment, in any domain, is better than not. Period. So everything a company can do to make employees feel comfortable to work should be tried. Every single employee is serving other people, whether externally (e.g. customers) or internally (in-house service). 

    In consulting we call this ""servant leaders"" for managers/execs, and it trickles down to everyone when real enough. Wherever you fall on this spectrum, from the 'servant' mindset (we provide, we are here to give whatever we can, that's how we _make_ value) to the 'territorial' mindset (we conquer, we are here to take whatever we can, that's how we _hoard_ value) ultimately decides your agility as a company / team / individual. Are you afraid of losing value, or are you willing to create some (thus necessarily both for yourself and others)?

Essentially I think it's a basic economic principle: value, like mass, doesn't ""do"" anything by itself (the greatest service with the greatest minds is worth nothing if it doesn't help anyone). Value is only ""felt"", thus impactful, when it _moves_, when it's projected at something and put in motion (e.g. the transfer of service skills to improve everyone's environment, that is when value is extracted from this service department to benefit materially every other department, or customer). In fact, we encourage people to think of everybody as a customer, especially in-house employees. 

It's an almost 1:1 correlation that companies who fail to 'serve' their own goal (the ""higher-than-us"", ""why we do this"") tend to crawl under their own weigth, collapse at the hand of their own structure (instead of being conducive to good work, it becomes detrimental to it). That's when the best employees leave, or left already if they saw it coming.

You hear the word ""culture"" thrown left and right from blogs to harvard business studies, well that's what it comes down to in real life in my limited / educated experience. Are you serving or are you taking, are you empowering others freely or defending your perceived power (let alone be hostile), are you a collection of mutually eating parasites or are you creating more value together than you ever could in isolation. That goes for how you treat external customers as well, if we are talking sustainability.

Ah.... I'm rambling. So many years of consulting. Always the same stories, and they almost always end up in failure. I don't even take those jobs anymore, it's a lost cause and I'd rather save the good people there than the company itself at that point."

NT4's reputation for crashing was almost entirely due to poor-quality third party drivers and hardware, after Microsoft's fateful decision to put the graphics and printing subsystem into protected memory space in order to equal the performance of Unix X11 CAD machines.

The crashes were so bad, that Microsoft locked the *resolution* of Server 2003 in order to indirectly discourage anyone from installing a graphics-card driver.
