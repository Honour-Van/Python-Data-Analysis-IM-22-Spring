I will automatically mark this post as in progress so that only one person is working on a post at any given time. **Please check that the post does not break the parent sub’s rules before claiming.**


When you're done, please comment again with `done`. Your flair will be updated to reflect the number of posts you've transcribed and the post will be marked as completed.

Here's [a checklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/checklist) that might help you out!

Post type: image. Please use the following formatting:

---

**Note**: Use one of these format guides by copying and pasting everything in the blue markdown box and replacing the prompts with the relevant information. **If you are using New Reddit, please switch your comment editor to Markdown Mode, not Fancy Pants Mode.**

**Remember**: We want to transcribe the text exactly as seen, so please do not make corrections to typos or grammatical errors. Copy emojis into your transcription by finding the proper character in emojipedia.

4,transcribersofreddit,1580998326.0,1.0,"Hi there! Please read and accept our Code of Conduct so that we can get you started with transcribing. Please read the Code of Conduct below, then respond to this comment with `I accept`.

After you respond, I'll process your claim as normal. A mod will check in and give you feedback when you’re finished!

---

Code of Conduct
-

* **Follow the Format Guides:** All transcriptions **must** follow our [format guides](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/guidelines). This helps make all transcriptions consistent and shows a good first impression to other users. **This is mandatory.** Consistently ignoring formatting after warnings from the mods will result in a temporary ban (see below). Please note that if you are using New Reddit, your comment editor must be in Markdown Mode, not Fancy Pants Mode.
 

* **Be Aware of Your Surroundings:** As a transcriber, you are temporarily the face of /r/TranscribersOfReddit and a guest in another community. Be courteous and friendly. If you do not know the answer to someone’s question, refer them to our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index) or [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTranscribersOfReddit). Do not be rude or sarcastic, even to trolls: we have suggestions about responding to questions and criticism [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/conduct).

* **Use Formal Language:** When talking to other users in your capacity as a Transcriber, please always use (relatively) formal language and proper grammar (capitalization, no abbreviations, and punctuation as appropriate). 

* **Ask Us if You Need Help:** If you have any questions or find yourself in a situation that you cannot properly resolve, you can reach us through [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTranscribersOfReddit), the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZDDE3Pj) server, or by mentioning a mod by username.

* **Check the Parent Sub’s Rules:** Some partner subreddits have rules against posts with personal information, such as usernames. These posts should not be transcribed, even if they appear in the queue. Transcribing a rule-breaking post can result in bans from the parent subreddit as well as penalties from /r/TranscribersOfReddit.


Penalties
-

Failure to follow the above rules after a warning from a moderator is worthy of a temporary ban of 7 days. This is to allow time for further discussion with the mods about how to be a good transcriber. If issues continue, a permanent ban may be issued. We are providing a service for those who need it, and these rules help us do that to the best of our ability. Failing to follow them means our service is no longer helpful.
