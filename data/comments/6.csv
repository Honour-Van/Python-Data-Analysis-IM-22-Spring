5,samedhi,1623455165.0,3.0,"Fuck, I just took this survey and I don't think I put ""clojure"" anywhere in the survey (despite it being the principal work I have done in the last year). Just clicked the checkboxes that matched.

Autopilot-friday-15-minutes-from-end-of-workday brain for the win. :0"
6,yogthos,1623509097.0,11.0,"Unfortunately, this kind of marketing is important because non-technical people are in charge of technology decisions in many large organizations. When I was introducing Clojure at work the main hurdle was in convincing management that it was a viable technology. Such surveys make it much easier to alleviate concerns regarding staffing, training, and long term sustainability of the language.

Since it takes very little effort to complete the survey I see it as a net positive, even if the impact isn't huge. It just might be that one extra piece of evidence that somebody needs to convince their workplace to give Clojure a shot. :)"
