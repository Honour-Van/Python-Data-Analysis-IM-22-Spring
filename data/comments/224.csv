Haskell is pure functional and interesting to learn but I struggled to find uses for it. I've had far more success with Clojure, which is a Lisp running on the JVM (and can compile to JavaScript). The simplicity of Lisps is a real joy to work with and favouring function composition and immutability has great benefits when you go back to writing imperative OO code."
1,nutrecht,1490946765.0,1.0,"For your day to day work I think it would make sense to first of all go deeper into what's currently the 'best practices' in the PHP world. Where most tutorials still mix PHP and HTML in a single file, in the 'real' world most companies use frameworks like Symphony or Laravel that neatly separate stuff into separate layers.

Aside from that, diving deeper into OO and functional programming is also helpful. For that using languages that are more strictly OO (Java, C#) or more strictly functional (Haskell, Scala) are helpful because they tend to force you in the right direction more.

On the other hand if stuff like machine learning / data science interests you Python is used a lot in that area."
2,wonderful_wonton,1490949594.0,1.0,"Java is super easy.  I'm not sure I'd pick that as a language to broaden into.  If you're already web programming, how about learning ""functional"" Javascript?  That's supposedly a leading-edge thing to learn nowadays, I think.  You can learn functional programming and test driven development with Javascript and be more leading edge with the web programming, and then move onto another language.

Python is a good scripting language choice.  Java is good for object oriented design, but like I said, it's really easy and there's not much of a challenge there."
3,samrapdev,1491065431.0,1.0,I've heard this advice over and over. Guess it's time I finally listen and practice with a functional language ;)
4,samrapdev,1490947081.0,1.0,"Yea, we use Laravel for most of our web applications or for some things it's custom + Symfony components/other packages. I'm certainly no newbie when it comes to best practices and I know how to build a good web app. Just looking to get more into architecture now. 

While I agree Java is more strictly OO, I think I have enough experience to force myself in the right direction. I'm reading a book on design patterns where the examples are in Java and I'm having no problem implementing them in PHP. "
