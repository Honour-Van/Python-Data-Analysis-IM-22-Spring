1,ergoproxy300,1653057015.0,396.0,"The archeologists had done an amazing job, the Computer was clean, perhaps it was cleaned with soap even. Impressed, I took a seat in front of the flickering screen, in a dingy room inside the national archeology building. In past ever since AI took over, it reached singularity on its own, leaving human deadweight behind on this forsaken planet. And roughly 500 years had passed since last computer engineer automated last manual task, making the subject obsolete.

As AI left this world, humanity needed intelligence again, to build the ecosystem they had become reliant upon. I blew over the keyboard. It did nothing as they had cleaned the computer pretty good, but I like to imagine some dust was blown away.

In front of me was a CRT monitor with a bright flickering screen, oldest of the oldest model and processor was something called 'Celeron'. I knew this because it said so on the big white box by my side. I clicked the internet button shaped as an English alphabet E. Why was it shaped as E if it a button for internet? Perhaps the ancient ones called it enternet, I thought. Yes, because we are entering into a net....of computers. I smirked to myself and watched as the it launched open a window.

I read the first thing it displayed in awe. 'ERROR CODE 404'. I took of my glasses with shaking hands. What was it? A mysterious code that the enternet was giving me, was it a hint? I immediately informed my superiors about it. They told me to look deeper and find its meaning, this could unlock the mysteries of what happened with previous AI. I clicked the button, F1, as it asked me to, for more help. It launched another window with text of reasons why I wasn't connected to the internet.

Ecstatic, I frantically started to note down everything, In the background was a camera filming everything on the screen. After an hour of noting down the entire page, I faxed it to my superiors, the first findings of many. They were happy as well and promised me a promotion.

After clicking on various objects on screen, I finally spotted the URL bar, it was my only way to restore the strongest of the ancient text, said to possess answer to every secret in the world, THE STACKOVERFLOW. In my mind they called it because they used to keep these texts in a neat pile of stacks. But people frequently used to refer to it and it used to spill. And as people kept adding more and more knowledge to it, the stack grew bigger and it overflowed in the library. Which was the reason that they put this entire thing on enternet.

I typed in the cryptic language given to me, very carefully and pressed the button. It once again threw 'NOT connected to Internet' page. Perhaps old master's spelling wasn't good as they called it internet instead of enternet. I opened the diary filled with instructions, unsure of what to do I walked around the humming machine. By chance I noticed the yellow wire sticking out a little. I pressed it in place and it clicked.

What did I do? did I push the enternet button? Did I break it? I went to the screen again and it was buffering. A small circle, spinning, like a small endless existence of itself, perhaps a message from the ancient ones. I noted it down too as the screen flickered and revealed the Stackoverflow home page. I went back weak in my knees due to how divine the moment was. 'Make an account' text appeared. Ofcourse, I have to clarify my account with the deities in order to get their blessing to go ahead. I bowed down before the first page of ancient text.

""Please ancient ones, I a humble servant appear before enternet, and your divinity. My purpose is just and true and for the restoration of humanity. Allow me to proceed."" When I lifted my head back up, the home page was still there. I carefully clicked a random button on it and the previous text disappeared. Ofcourse, I had made the account already, the ancient ones heard it and granted me access.

""How to restore AI"" I typed in carefully, as it was the only question I had. The search query returned the result. ""Make sure the server is on and connected to the internet' it said.

'The server' I exclaimed, the reference to which was found all through out the history. In fact, the server was the only thing left behind of the AI, but it was a digital artifact. I immediately informed the superiors and they arranged for it to be connected to the same Yellow wire which was supplying my machine with enternet. 

I scrolled down for second answer as I had followed to the first, ""does the code have any issues?' What was this? a question? in the text full of answers? What is 'The code'? Ofcourse, ancient text referenced this 'the code' of the machines. Perhaps a set of regulations and rules made for them....by machine police.

But where was this code? I asked. Perhaps I should ask the server. I informed the superiors about my findings and now I am headed with the ancient machine to server room, to find this 'Great code' and understand it. Only then humanity will be led to its salvation."
2,PenguinPeculiaris,1653060121.0,100.0,"The oracle stared back at me, blank-faced and dim. This was going to be a long night.

Oracles were known for being unreliable before we forgot how to use them, and these days almost none of them still worked. This one had not been woken for some time; dust clogged its every surface when I'd started work on it, well over a week ago.

This was a larger specimen, headless, with many redundant organs, and lacking many of the appendages usually afforded to an oracle, despite having the necessary orifices for them to link into. Only recently had we discovered the purpose behind these so called 'headless oracles'. This is why they called me in.

Being the resident expert in oracology , I had the best chances of being able to revive this one. Most of the time, my job is to turn up and declare the job to be impossible. Most oracles discovered in the past 50 years have been mere fossils.

This time was different. The site had been discovered a decade ago in the arctic, as humans migrated to colder areas of the world to escape the rising temperatures. The site itself was modest, simple structures and infrastructure apparently designed specifically for housing oracles of this kind. Red tape, politics and the usual theological fretting common to our species prevented any research expeditions from occurring until now.

Since being permitted onto the site, we had devoted a week to cleaning, cataloguing and studying each of the oracles housed here. There were well over 50 specimens. And yet still, I took the greatest of care in my attempts to repair this first one.

""FUUUCK!!!"" I growled. This was the seventh time I had tried to kickstart it, to no avail. In other circumstances, I'd have written the machine off, but this was everything. According to the texts they had found onsite, this oracle was special; it was the master oracle which the other 49 depend on for full functioning, apparently. Its respiratory system remained entirely inert.

I had only one thing left to try. From my orocologists bag, I withdrew a small rubber percussive device. After what was probably not enough hesitation, I gave each of the organs a light whack. People liked to joke that the orocologist's hammer was a useless tool, fit only for relieving ones frustrations.

I hit the power switch, and just about fell out of my chair.

<BEEP>!

The sweetest noise an orocologist could hear. It was the sound of life returning to the dead.

<POWER ON SELF TEST COMPLETED. OK>  


<INITIALIZING BOOT SEQUENCE...>  


<...>

<...>

< Enter authorization for soverflowadnmn@bashv4.2:  >

Our team had already found the authorization codes during cataloguing, which I tapped in as best as I could with how my hands shook.

---------

A week later, we had woken a small subset of the oracles. The master oracle was not enough by itself, apparently a mere middleman between the others.

""We're ready!"" The excitement palpable in her voice, Roshenke announced her success at activating the oracle's true function.

Roshenke wrote the words into the box: 'http://localhost:80'. The result was immediate the viewer filled with shapes, colours, and most importantly, words!

< Welcome to stack overflow! >

< Every Sysadmin has a tab open to stack overflow >

My hairs stood straight. For moments, nobody breathed. Nobody was capable of speech. We knew this expedition would be huge, but we did not know we were unearthing the holy grail of orocology.

""QUICK ASK IT SOMETHING!"" Ruiz barked

My head swimming, I dared look back at the viewer. The screen was filled with questions-- and answers! I clicked one at random and scrolled down to the answer, hasty in my greed:

< ""This is a stupid question. You just didn't want to learn Matrix maths for your homework, did you?"" >

*I never know how to end these so I'm just going to leave it there! Bit wordier than I'd have liked but oh well. PS, it turns out I don't enjoy first person narration 🤷*"
3,Zackypoo123,1653057970.0,57.0,"It is said that any program can be created simply by copying and pasting from this sacred place: Stack Overflow. No matter how complex or simple, it would be possible. 

The search began with a basic browser window, this relic machine came with one built in called google chrome. Was this the google that nearly achieved world domination in our history? Anyway, it didn’t matter, google was preached too be the path to Stack Overflow. 

After waiting a little too long, the browser opened to a page with a solitary search bar in the middle. I think this is where I enter Stack Overflow, and the letters are slowly but surely typed in. 

As the letters appeared on the search bar, sentences formed within a box below:
‘Stacy’s Mom has got it going on classic’
K was entered:
‘Stacking cups world champion’
What are all these weird suggestions? I thought google would guide me there.
Oh well, I will keep typing.

Finally, it was all entered, now the box showed things that made sense. Enter, now let’s see what happens. At the top of the page, there was now a number, it showed there were millions of results! This wouldn’t be any easy task. 

Hours pass, I have sifted through results from dozens of pages of this search. So far it all seems like gibberish, and the more pages I visit, the more confused I am becoming. This was a gargantuan task, and the only thing I have learnt so far is the importance of this semi-colon thing.

Restarting the research from the beginning was the best idea, time too search through all one hundred tabs again. This must be what it feels like too be an ancient developer."

""How do I restore access to the store of all knowledge Wikipedia?"" My first attempt to click the mystical link missed, my hands were shaking.

Slowly the page loaded line by line. Sweat dripped from my forehead despite the cold.  The store of all knowledge! It could change everything, elevate us from this dark age.  Finally the only line of the only answer appeared on the screen.
