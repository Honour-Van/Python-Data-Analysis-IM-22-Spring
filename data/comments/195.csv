4,DS_avatar,1613909119.0,5.0,"NB there are a few indices that measure programming language popularity on various scales and update regularly, such as TIOBE and PYPL."
5,Fnatlaf,1613927576.0,5.0,HTML and CSS are generally not considered 'programming languages'.
6,Pii-oner,1613960353.0,1.0,"This index is also interesting:

Results are different though."

9,TKSmoothie2,1613929035.0,1.0,Exactly. Apples and Oranges all through this.
10,Alexrilikepie,1613961877.0,3.0,"can confirm, if you seriously program and don’t use stack overflow I am extremely impressed"
11,Blue31415,1613974887.0,1.0,"It would be nice to see a survey of languages ranked by helpfulness of documentation, or usefulness of basic functions. If you have a high level language that can do a lot, it can solve problems easier kinda, right? So I would think python would be underrepresented maybe a little? I think popularity is best determined by occurrences of language on job postings."
