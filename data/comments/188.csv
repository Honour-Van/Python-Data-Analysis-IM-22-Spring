2,JessieArr,1649282681.0,156.0,"FYI, OP - the StackOverflow data is in the Creative Commons and is released in a bulk data dump periodically on [Archive.org](https://Archive.org): [https://archive.org/download/stackexchange](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange)

I've used this in the past to create an [offline viewer](https://github.com/JessieArr/StackOfflineFlow) for StackOverflow data (as a toy project to see if I could - don't anyone get excited thinking it's good enough to be actually useful.)

I was able to take the bulk data and implement a desktop app that can perform a trivial in-place [search of the XML data dump](https://github.com/JessieArr/StackOfflineFlow/blob/master/StackOfflineFlow/StackOfflineFlow/Services/StackOverflowBulkDataService.cs#L53), so you might be able to use that data to seed this site as well if you wanted to keep going with this project."

4,Philpax,1649287043.0,115.0,"Hey mate, good effort and it's really impressive that you've put all this work in, but your code needs a lot of work. You have a lot of redundancy and inconsistency, and there's significant room for improvement across the board.

It's hard to give you a detailed breakdown of what to address as the codebase is so large; instead, I'd suggest working on smaller codebases and practice the areas where you find your code to be difficult to read, overly verbose, or otherwise more complicated than it needs to be. It'll take a while to develop a feel for this, but it's worth the effort.

Practice makes perfect and you're clearly capable of putting the hours in; I'm sure you'll be able to rise up high and show us another project before long!"

I notice a lot of formatting errors all over this project my suggestion is to user or configure your editor such that it will automatically format. [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) is a good example of this.

Also for Js and Python use a linter for example eslint and pylint are common ones (others are available)."

Consider adding sign in and login via OpenID Connect like Google etc. Many people are willing to give you an OAuth token rather than enter a password into your database, when they're trying a random app created by someone.

I mentioned this in another comment already, btw, but fantastic work. Your code is messy and poorly architected which shows that you're a beginner, but this is a huge, mostly functional project. It's extremely impressive to see this from a beginner. I think you have a great future in coding ahead of you. :)"

We all started out like this. My first 'big' project probably wasn't as large as this one. But I felt like really hot shit too. It had actual users even! It was basically a webscraping tool that I built to scrape user profiles from forums and present all kinds of statistics. It was very functional.

The code however was at least as bad as yours. I never heard of SQL injection for example, but I certainly hope no one found out and stole passwords. I would not have known if they did; someone dropping the database would probably have been a best case scenario :) I had massive monster PHP files too :)

So; keep it up! Don't get demotivated by people calling your code crap. I mean it is. But we all started writing crap code :) The feedback is what makes you learn."

Yes, there are many things you could've done better, but this is already extremely impressive as it stands. I'm not really an expert but I recommend splitting your files into smaller ones because a 5000 line file is very very long, and you should also avoid alot of these if else if chains by using dictionaries or by directly setting the value. You could also leave some more comments in the code that explain what things do.

Just keep up the good work man and you will get better as time passes, we all start with code that's not optimal. :)

P. S. Rest assured many of the people here haven't done anything that's even remotely close to the scale of your project, so don't pay those negative people too much mind. Just take the positive criticism where you can."
22,Markm_256,1649288996.0,9.0,"I think this is a fantastic achievement! And it even looks nice too :)

That said - I wouldn't encourage using this for real use - as many people have mentioned - it doesn't look like it would scale well.

Regarding code - you have a lot of duplication (just to pick something for easy feedback...)

Code at [https://github.com/Yawan-1/StackOverFlow--Clone/blob/master/qa/views.py#L2970](https://github.com/Yawan-1/StackOverFlow--Clone/blob/master/qa/views.py#L2970)

Could be refactored to something like:

```python
                    for bv in que.bounty_set.all():
                        if bv.bounty_value in ('50', '100', '150', ...):
                            Reputation.objects.create(
                                answer_O=post,
                                answer_rep_C=int(bv.bounty_value),
                                awarded_to=post.answer_owner,
                                reputation_on_what='Bounty_Awarded')
                            PrivRepNotification.objects.get_or_create(
                                for_user=post.answer_owner,
                                type_of_PrivNotify=""BOUNTY_AWARDED_REP_P"",
                                url=question_URL,
                                answer_priv_noti=post,
                            )
```


There are many places where such refactoring would make the code easier to understand.

I.e. I didn't look through all options to 500 to see if it was really the same code - but if doing the above - any different handling would likely be clearer - as it would need to be done explicitly."

Yes, most senior engineers would most likely have a field day on code review. However, I hope you take this as a reminder that execution trumps all: you don't need the prettiest code or use the newest ""best practices"" to build something cool or something of value.

Yes being a strong IC who can write ""clean"" code is great, but business empires have been built on shit code. In that case, what kind of value do I bring to my company, and the world in general?

Setting up that sort of stuff is really dependent on what languages (and potentially frameworks) you use, what database you go with and then what you use in your code to communicate with that database.

As a result, the best advice one can give is, well, practice. Pick a well-documented language you know, pick a popular database, and follow some documentation to get everything running. Once you've done that, dive into the docs for what you used and you can build a better understanding of how they work.

To go one step further would be to look into how to write your _own_ library for interacting with a database. That'll involve more looking into the documentation for that database."

    if TagBadge.objects.filter(awarded_to_user=profileData.user,badge_type=""BRONZE"", tag_name=""Citizen Patrol"",bade_position=""BADGE"").exists():
        ctzn_ptrl_earned = True
    else:
        ctzn_ptrl_earned = False

From this, you can see that you are still a beginner. A more advanced programmer would just use the boolean return value (or cast to bool if needed) :

    ctzn_ptrl_earned = TagBadge.objects.filter(awarded_to_user=profileData.user,badge_type=""BRONZE"", tag_name=""Citizen Patrol"",bade_position=""BADGE"").exists()

And to write maintainable code, you have to create some abstractions, classes and functions.

Like this:

    class BadgeDatabase:
        def has_badge(self, user, badge_type, tag_name):
            return TagBadge.objects.filter(awarded_to_user=user,badge_type=badge_type, tag_name=tag_name,bade_position=""BADGE"")

It's actually decent if you write all your own code and only use Pyright (which is a very good Python static type checker) but in reality you will use lots of third party libraries with nonexistent or wrong type annotations, and they probably use MyPy which is not very good and even disagrees with Pyright about some things (because the semantics of Python type annotations are undefined).

Typescript is better in almost every way. If you're considering Python you should slap yourself and consider Typescript instead, in almost every situation. The only exceptions are if there's some library you really need to use, e.g. Pytorch.

To be fair I'd half put Django in that category. There aren't many server frameworks that are as complete and easy to use.

Static typing offers many benefits for programming in the large - especially for reasoning about complex systems - and I find anything beyond toy codebases in Python to be frustrating to work with as a result.

If you're planning on building a service or an application to last, I would agree that you should really use TypeScript, or Go, or C# instead.

Well, yeah, Python is a Dynamically typed language. The best you'll (reasonably) get is `type hinting`. But if you're a disciplined developer, you can do really well with this.

That said, I get it. Coding in Django everyday, I still get bit by Python type errors on a semi-regular basis, despite using full type hinting everywhere. And List comprehension / generator syntax still isn't as good as C#'s LINQ, but it's good enough.

Kind of funny you would bring both of those up. They've both written their own Python engines because CPython is so slow, and they both gave up in the end.

Since ""just rewrite the whole thing from scratch"" is a death sentence for any sizable project, the solution was to move as many parts as possible into back-end web services, implemented mostly in C++, and try to starve the Python so there was less of it that needed to be scaled by brute force.

That said, of course I disagree with the parent comment that implied Python has almost no valid use cases.  That's ridiculous.

It's no use if someone tells me my code sucks (without elaborating) even though it's the first iteration, especially if it's open source and when you're kinda proud of it.

Even the other parent comments that shudder at variable names, thread sleeps etc. are better feedback and more honest and direct than just saying "" that's not good, long road ahead. good luck you'll need it"""
