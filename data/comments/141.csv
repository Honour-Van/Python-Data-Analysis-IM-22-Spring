Should you learn it? That's up to you to decide. But don't be a [magpie developer](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-magpie-developer/). Learn the fundamentals. Once you are confident enough on your base, you can switch languages with less problems. Sure, there will always be a learning curve. But the stronger your foundation, the easier it gets.

They like hiring ""intermediate"" developers, as they call them.

As you can imagine, I can only speak for the interview process at my currenty employer - and other companies I've had a hand in hiring for (three including this one.)

We are a small company and don't frequently hire (one or twice a year, to fill in vacancies). Acquiring a role here basically comes down to the following:

1. An intermediate knowledge of HTML and CSS. Being able to use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap 3 to build simple dashboards, data entry systems, etc.

2. A good understanding of the C# language, including LINQ.

3. A general understanding of the wider Microsoft .NET ecosystem, including WCF (nice to have), Entity Framework (important), SQL Server (more on that later).

4. A moderate level of expertise on database technologies; particularly MS SQL Server. Including modeling tables to reflect customer data/problems, maintaining referential integrity with JOINs/FKs, etc.

5. A strong working knowledge of ASP.NET. Currently we're testing against MVC 4 or 5 (they're so similar as to make little difference). This includes rendering Razor views, understanding controllers, consuming data providers (general concept, this isnt' an ASP.NET thing) from your controllers, using ""real life"" data to render views (like a table of users), using MVC intrinsics like HTML helpers for rendering HTML."

I've hired for three employers total. One was an enterpreneur who owned about a half dozen new and used car dealerships/franchises. One was a mid-sized IT/managed services company (100+ employees) with a small development branch, and then the aforementioned one up the chain.

In all cases, they've been looking for someone that can dive into a specific project immediately. They aren't really interested in generalized talent; either you know the skills - or you don't. In that regard, it's pretty black and white.

That having been said, that doesn't preclude you from getting into these sorts of positions without practical work experience, if you're concerned about that.

Four years ago, I was working a minimum wage midnight shift job. I taught myself angularjs (among other things) and pitched myself on the market as an angular specialist. I found a company (the mid-sized IT firm) that had dire need of a very senior angularjs developer. Truth told, I wasn't that great at it (as I discovered by looking at my old code a few months into my job there), but I _sounded_ confident and could speak to all the topics that they were interested in. They hired me off the street, and I grew into a senior tech lead position there over the next six months.

If a hypothetical candidate wanted a position at my current employer, I'd tell them to learn C# inside and out, have a moderate amount of practical experience in ASP.NET, and dabble in EF/SQL Server/WCF just to have some talking points. The bar isn't really set that high; we're not looking for people that can solve Dijkstra's algorithm on a whiteboard. If you can fetch a collection of users out of a DB and render an HTML table off of those users, you're probably good enough.

Be able to confidently speak to things like Razor, MVC, and LINQ, and accomplish task that literally any web dev should be able to do (like basic CSS), and - in my experience - you're hireable."

In Angular and Java, those principles are more heavily enforced within the nature of the framework itself.

In React, you CAN do SOLID and Dependency Injection, but most React Developers aren't going have the same mindset as most Angular/Java Developers.

React follows more of a vanilla JavaScript approach. Heavy focus on the JAVASCRIPT side of things.

Angular follows more with the nature of Java / C#. That's why Angular is seen as an easier transition from a Java / C# Developer than React or Vue.

React/Vue focus more on ES6/JavaScript syntax.

I'm not saying SOLID is useless. I have never made that claim. I'm just saying most React Developers who come from Coding Bootcamps will not know what they don't know, such that they will not know that Dependency Injection or SOLID is even a thing.

68,,1559249532.0,1.0,"Are you Front-End, Back-End, Full-Stack?"
69,,1559249690.0,2.0,"Software Architecture is more about the overall system rather than on one specific part. But I’m a full stack developer as well. Angular front end with .net core backend, but also utilizing python, and node for work outside the core of the system."
70,,1559249787.0,1.0,"What's your opinion on the future of Java Spring Boot? Will it get ""killed off"" by ASP.NET Core going forward with .NET5 and all that, or will it survive and still have the dominant market share within enterprises?"
71,,1559250061.0,2.0,I’m not familiar with Java frameworks at all. I don’t think .net 5 really represents a paradigm shift or anything. It’s just continuation of core. Java has too much momentum behind it to be killed off by Microsoft. It’s not going anywhere.
72,,1559250290.0,1.0,"I personally want to learn about ASP.NET Core. It seems like an interesting technology.

I'm just honestly confused why it seems like a lot of people follow .NET almost religiously.

It disturbs me to see C# developers being like: oh look Blazor allows you to do everything in C#. You don't need to touch JavaScript. JS sucks. Java sucks. Everything should be in C#.

In my opinion, and this is just my opinion, C# is just one out of many technologies that you COULD use to develop web apps.

What are your thoughts about this?"
73,,1559251679.0,2.0,"Few reasons: 

1.) Companies who use .Net probably will use .Net for everything. And you can make a successful career around just knowing .net

2.) C# is just a really fucking good language. I use python for auxiliary systems at work, but primarily because my coworkers responsible for those systems (not developers) only know python. I’ve toyed with Node/Rust/C/C++/some Java and there is nothing about those languages that makes me want to switch. I can do everything in .net. Video Games? Mono game/XNA/Unity/Godot. Websites? ASP.Net. Ultra fast caches and Databases? You can do that too. Does it do everything the best or the fastest? Nope. But the developer experience around it is nice enough to make up for it. 

3.) the tooling is fantastic. Visual Studio is my favorite IDE. VSCode is my second. When I focused .net instead of Java when I was first learning the fact that there were no proper dark theme ide’s for windows made it an easy decision. 

4.) the (previously) walled garden of .net keeps developers locked in. When it came to .net framework you were stuck on windows in visual studio. Unless you wanted to fight against Xamarin issues. 

As for Blazor:

That’s less an embrace of .net and more a dissatisfaction with JS. Web Assembly is coming and people are writing compilation targets to get .net/rust/c/etc all running in the browser. 

Personally I don’t see the point for normal web development. I actually love JavaScript and TypeScript. I have yet to hit a problem in the front end space that I thought “wow I wish I had web Assembly for this”. I suspect most of the hype around blazor and web Assembly is largely “holy shit we can run .net in the browser now!” And the hype will eventually die off. Although there is something very appealing about code reuse between front and back end systems allowing for write once validate anywhere business logic etc. 

Also I had mentioned in pms about fable, which does allow for f# front to back. But that just uses Babel to transpire the f# into js. It’s similar to elm in that it makes writing functional front end code easier."
74,,1559253313.0,1.0,"In an ideal world, do you think every and all companies should be using ASP.NET Core to develop new web apps?

What is ASP.NET Core NOT good for, in your opinion compared to something like Rails, Django, Laravel, or Node/Go?"
75,,1559255662.0,2.0,"Not at all. Choice is good. I love core, I doubt I’ll ever use anything other than core for the foreseeable future (after this job it’s mini retirement for a few years then I’ll start my own development coop), but competition of ideas is good for the ecosystem. 

I’d definitely recommend developers use core though over rails and Django. I’d use Django if I needed to write a service for a module my non developer coworkers. But not outside of that (although Django was my first mvc framework I learned). Node has the benefit of the same language and is useful for small services, although core is also great for small services. 

I don’t use concurrency very often and the concurrency I do use in c# is pretty straightforward so I can’t really compare it against Go in that regard. Although if Concurrency was that big of a deal I’d probably reach for rust personally, since I’m familiar enough with it."
