0,jacojerb,1595824383.0,35.0,"That's higher than the general population. Only about 5% of the US identifies as lgbt, meaning that game devs are more likely to be lgbt than the general population"
1,,1595852482.0,3.0,"Cool, but what does sexual orientation have to do with developing anything?"
2,Tall-skinny,1595863347.0,2.0,why was bi twice as high as gay
3,henare,1595826209.0,15.0,afaik the developers in the stack overflow survey aren't necessarily *game* developers ...
4,Ultimafatum,1595840183.0,15.0,Only about 5% of the US **openly** identifies as lgbt\*
5,totalhomo,1595824697.0,4.0,Very interesting! I did not know that 5% of the general population was gay
6,zephrun,1595859778.0,7.0,nothing really. and neither does gender yet there is a lower proportion if females compared to males in the industry too. it's still an interesting statistic to know. whether that indicates any correlated preferences or what not is something no-one can really confirm without researching into it.
7,,1595867566.0,2.0,Nothing. The survey is just providing self identified demographics of the respondents.
8,totalhomo,1595864085.0,1.0,🤷‍♀️
9,goodworld2u,1595888132.0,1.0,Because bisexuals likely outnumber gays significantly. Just like how straight people outnumber both gay and bisexual people.
10,jacojerb,1595829641.0,9.0,"I misread. Guess my brain autocorrected ""gay developers"" to ""game developers""..."
11,,1595841896.0,9.0,That still means that developers have a higher than average percentage are gay. Or at the very least are more likely to be openly gay. Either is a positive for me.
12,henare,1595826252.0,-11.0,that's 5% LG ... so if you're gay then approximately half of that.
13,karnim,1595829960.0,17.0,That's not how math works.
14,henare,1595831848.0,-4.0,If 5 percent of the population is lesbian or gay then you're proposing that lesbians and gays are suitable substitutes for each other...
15,karnim,1595833207.0,13.0,"If 5% of the population is gay, then 5% of men are gay, and 5% of women are gay. The ratio doesn't change if you limit by the gender someone is attracted to."
16,Miss_Skooter,1595837502.0,9.0,"5% is gay aka 2.5% are gay males and 2.5% are lesbian females with the total being the entire population (if we can assume it's an equal distribution)

2.5% of the whole population is 5% of half the population.

So you end up with 5% of males are gay and 5% of females are lesbians."
