0,,1463193793.0,49.0,"Yeah, I've been seeing these, too, and wondering where they've been coming from.

I, too, much prefer working in a Linux environment, but I'm always perplexed when I see these ""XYZ is going to own the market!"" posts, because they always are based on some technology, in this case Linux, completely taking over the market in a space where that technology isn't really very hot, in this case (based on the posts lately) corporate desktops and internal application hosts.

But that completely ignores the scope of the technological world and where these things get used.  Personally I don't see many posts from Windows people asserting that nobody uses Linux, although I've been told they're out there.  To believe such a thing, a person would have to be completely ignorant of all the places where Linux is used.  Similarly, when /r/Linux is going on about how Linux is going to Take Over The World just as soon as ""M$"" agrees to support Skype on it, it kind of betrays a misunderstanding that Linux on the desktop, while certainly *possible*, is pretty much entirely beside the point.

As for Microsoft's porting tech to Linux... it seems pretty clear to me that they're going to start trying to position Windows as a platform that's just as available and performant as Linux.  This is a push *into* realms where Linux has dominated.  Now when some startup Dockerizes their whole platform of microservices and starts pushing into the Cloud, Microsoft can come in and say, ""Hey, for pennies more per instance, you can migrate your entire platform -- without modification! -- to Windows, and it'll work just as well except you'll have a multibillion-dollar company behind it.""  That's not ""we're giving up on Windows,"" it's completely the opposite.

Which is all to say that I pretty much agree.  Windows is being maneuvered away from the admin experience it used to be, which looks to a lot of people like ""Windows is dying,"" but I think this is because it's being positioned to become more competitive in an area of IT with which they aren't really cognizant of because it's not what they do.  Which is fine, but it's leading them to the wrong conclusion."

In my opinion, a good engineer should know that most products have their place and that a 'right tool for the right job' approach is best. Sometimes it's Linux, sometimes it's Windows and sometimes it's something else."

This, in spite of the fact that almost every (maybe every?) vendor appliance we run, physical or virtual, runs Linux, and in my vertical (k12), clients are rushing en masse to Chromebooks, Gmail and iOS. In many cases students won't touch Windows/Office again for a long time.

24,,1463354553.0,1.0,"> Native Linux/bash support.

Personally, I believe that this is less about providing something for developers, and more of a way to ultimately provide support for Linux-based Docker packages to run on Windows Server (and in Azure). Having developers test it in a development environment while it is labeled as beta is a great way for them to flush out all of the problems without the fallout of something not working in Server or on Azure. Microsoft has been putting a lot of money into providing support for Docker in Windows for Windows-based packages.

They've been putting more effort into having their products used at multiple levels instead of being forced to use their entire top-down infrastructure. With things like the ""Windows Subsystem for Linux"" (its not *just* bash on Windows, afterall), open-sourcing of .net components, SQL Server being released for Linux, etc, they're moving in a direction of using their applications regardless of platform or their platform regardless of applications.

I'd predict that we'll eventually see more server application products be released for non-Windows platforms. They're starting with SQL Server--which makes more money than their Server OS line. I'd be surprised if Exchange and Active Directory aren't far behind.

The reality is that Microsoft will make more money off of selling CALs or per-user costs for AD in Azure than the initial cost of a Windows Server license. How much of the cost of a Server license is the OS and how much are the services that come with it? They'll just sell the services as services for an appropriate amount.

The bigger move would be if the .net stuff for Linux starts being used by Microsoft to allow UWP applications to run on Linux. They're positioning themselves to be a market for their platform, their applications, their cloud services, their development environment, or any combination of those.

Apple doesn't really even play the Enterprise game.  They just happen to make both a very solid OS and laptop and iOS is very secure and great for business to adapt.

The thing about the Mac platform is all the big enterprise tools are third party - Casper, , Munki, Chef/Puppet, Deploy Studio, AutoPKG, AutoDMG, Airwatch, etc.  Apple just gives third parties APIs and says here are the tools, now you can make enterprise solutions.  As far as enterprise features OS X is just as solid as any other OS you would deploy, and Macbook Pros compared to our top of the line Lenovos we deploy that match spec for spec are about the same price.

Yeah all very valid points.  I will say though that Microsoft has always been very smart at business.  Any Org going through a huge shift is gonna have hiccups and gonna ship some bugs.   I don't think any Org can do a giant shift like this perfectly.  Sure it may hurt them, but I think they can bounce back.  They have the capital to hire top talent and as long as the vision isn't ridiculous they could pull it off.  

I am just saying if I was in the MS world I would be embracing the hell outta this and try to do things no one has done before and try to make the best of it.  I guess you can look at it one of two ways, or one of several ways.  

* embrace the change, adapt and learn to code and automate and make the MS stack just as viable as the other sides

* go about your business and complain about it

* invoke change and stop using MS (which I am willing to bet is the hardest one for most Orgs)

Python should not even be in the mix here.  It is not only a cross platform interpreted programming language but it doubles as a lazy scripting platform.  I say lazy because most devs I know would rather write a 60 line python script than learn to write a proper system shell script in either bash or PS.  Python is great but it's still a tertiary tool.

**Bringing bash to Windows is an attempt to take back some of the Web developer market**.  Most web devs are developing on Linux or OSX and have native ssh support among other things.  MS realizes that most of these people still use Windows and they are hoping that adding ssh support and some native bash functionality will keep people on their flagship platform.

I've used tools like cmdr (git-bash) and putty for a long time.  They are not ideal but they work.  **Native Windows support for Linux would certainly make me happier in some ways but mainly as having a system shell that doesn't suck donkey dicks.**

> Bringing bash to Windows is an attempt to take back some of the Web developer market. Most web devs are developing on Linux or OSX and have native ssh support among other things. MS realizes that most of these people still use Windows and they are hoping that adding ssh support and some native bash functionality will keep people on their flagship platform.

Um... Yes? I'm pretty sure that's called competing, the same thing you said in your first paragraph that they weren't doing. It also makes it much easier to have mixed environments as well.

> I've used tools like cmdr (git-bash) and putty for a long time. They are not ideal but they work. Native Windows support for Linux would certainly make me happier in some ways but mainly as having a system shell that doesn't suck donkey dicks.

If you seriously think the linux subsystem is a replacement for Powershell you're delusional. Windows is built around objects. Why would you manage it with a string-based shell?"

I don't mind the *de facto* lock in that comes from vendors offering an all-encompassing, vertical integration sort of solution. Sometimes it's just better to go all-in with one vendor like that. But what I do mind are vendors who sell deliberately inferior products to prevent escape.

In the medical industry, I've seen some of the worst. Each vendor goes all-in on secrecy and proprietary data storage. There's nothing technically special about their databases, they just like them because it means if you want to move to another program, you have to pay another company to reverse-engineer the format and lossily convert you to the new system.

Even though you are responsible for hosting and maintaining the database, you can't access it yourself; The vendor controls the user accounts and API keys, and only authorizes third-party applications that have paid them a fee for access to the customer base. How am I supposed to reconcile these ubiquitous practices with our regulatory obligation to preserve patient data for years? *Even in a disaster recovery scenario*, I've had these companies tell me they wouldn't disclose the file format for me to recover HIPAA-regulated data.

* Scale - MS is porting both MS SQL and .NET to Linux because Linux just scales better, if Linux wasn't a threat and MS was so much better they simply would not be doing this.  They want to remain relevant in the App world, and they are dying out because Linux simply scales better.  Don't believe me?  Look at the largest scale anything in IT/Tech, it always has a Linux back end.

* reliability - even MS is copying the state machine model, again late the game but they are copying it.

If MS was so much better at centralized control and scale in the Enterprise why are they making all these changes?  The answer is because they aren't the best at it, but they want to be the best at it again.
