http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015?ref=survey-2016#tech-editor

- the difference between ST and vim became smaller (relatively) compared to the previous study
- Atom grew substantially"

4,Anton31Kah,1492117479.0,1.0,It's bad for everyone I mean I never liked it since day one in Programming I fell in love with Sublime Text and even though everyone at my university uses it and all professors but I hate notepad++ I love Sublime Text 
5,Paradox,1492120254.0,2.0,"Periods and line breaks man. Periods and line breaks. I understood what you meant, but my internal linter is screaming"
