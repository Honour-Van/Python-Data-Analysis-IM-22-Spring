0,Lesabotsy,1652396958.0,3.0,Last year clojurians were the highest paid devs. How is the job market these days? Worth to get in?
1,jizzthonian,1652412460.0,5.0,Yes!
2,OknoLombarda,1652424359.0,2.0,"I think, if you have an opportunity, you should try it. There's not a single position for Clojure developer in my whole country, so I can't do it :c"
3,Lesabotsy,1652604505.0,1.0,Are you employed as a clojure dev? Mind sharing your experience? Where can I find those jobs?
4,Lesabotsy,1652429356.0,1.0,Try remote?
5,jizzthonian,1652626342.0,1.0,"I am and I will, we are a stealth mode startup so let me find out how much of what I can share. As for finding these jobs, we are hiring and are 100% fully remote."
6,OknoLombarda,1652436892.0,1.0,"I'm thinking about it. English is my second language and whenever I imagine the interview, I think something like ""damn they're gonna use some sophisticated vocabulary, I won't be able to understand and it will be so confusing"". That sounds hella stupid when I tell it to someone else, though... I guess I should try"
7,Lesabotsy,1652626858.0,1.0,Mind if I DM you? Have some questions
8,Lesabotsy,1652437048.0,3.0,"You write better than some native, your English is good enough. Just give it go, and report back so I can do the same after I learn the language if the experience is good ☺️"
9,bpiel,1652547117.0,2.0,"I've conducted many interviews. If someone told me that English were their second language, I would give them a lot of leeway when asking for clarifications."
10,jizzthonian,1652627259.0,1.0,Of course
11,OknoLombarda,1652437700.0,1.0,"Thanks, I'll try :D"
12,Lesabotsy,1652629775.0,1.0,DM'd
