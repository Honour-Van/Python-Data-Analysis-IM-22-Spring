StackOverflow isn't all bad, it's just important to understand that it's a different type of resource. It's trying to be a resource that collects one set of best answers to all good programming questions. It's not trying to be a resource to help beginners figure out what they're doing.

The difference is subtle. StackOverflow doesn't like it when someone asks the same question that's been answered a hundred times already, because it's not adding to the site. The beginner doesn't know that - to them it's a totally new question.

The reality is that 99% of beginner questions are likely to be ones that have already been answered. If you can't find the answers, you need a class, or a forum like /r/learnprogramming that's beginner-friendly.

Once you're past the beginner stage, you'll get better at searching for answers, and when you do come across really new questions that haven't ever been asked, you'll be able to write it up as a really good question that StackOverflow will help you with."

It's a place for documenting unique, well-stated questions and documenting well-written answers. 99% the time when people, including me, get a rude response on StackOverflow it's because their question didn't meet one or both of these requirements.

StackOverflow community is like that to keep the quality of questions and answers on StackOverflow very high."

9,jonnycross10,1647820316.0,15.0,My pet peeves is when they link you to an outdated post and mark yours as duplicate or they link you to an article that is similar to your question but doesn't actually answer your question. In the latter scenario specifically it makes it nearly impossible to get your questions answered as a beginner because you don't have the breadth of knowledge to extrapolate how a similar post could be relevant to your question.
10,NoHearing1817,1647832919.0,7.0,"#### The difference you have to realize, and you will come to appreciate SO when you are more proficient, is that SO is not a discussion forum.  

It is a Q&A forum, and you are expected to search for your answer before you post a question, and have a certain minimum level of skill (usually, they expect that you already know all the basics that should have been covered by a basic course or set of tutorials.. basic things like loops, control statements, etc., shouldn't be asked).   

#### Many people on SO are professionals, they do this for a living.  They don't have time to hand-hold.   

On the other hand,  this is /r/**learn**programming.  This is a discussion forum, so most of us are here as a hobby or for fun.  Sure, most of us are professionals in some areas of our lives but ultimately, folks here are just starting out."

When I started coding long ago at university, nobody was able to see the hundreds of dumb mistakes that I made getting started. I just threw the printouts into the trash.

These days, coding is much more learned in public and that can be intimidating.

Remember that only about 0.5 percent of the population in general knows anything at all about coding, so just the fact that you are starting to learn puts you in an elite group already.

Also remember, and I will make a bold prediction here, that computers are not going away any time soon. Forget the crap about AI replacing coding jobs because it ain't going to happen.

Stick in there are good luck!"
21,cacoethes_,1647990625.0,2.0,"I’m no beginner but I hate the culture in Stack  Overflow. It’s the whole mindset that they can keep questions of a certain format and list of requirements that get me. It’s so one-size-fits-all way of thinking and as we know that rule doesn’t work too well especially with the immense variety of programming issues out there. I get the necessity of order to keep the place from becoming oversaturated with nonsense, but they can be very arrogant about it. Stack overflow is my last resort when I really can’t find anything that answers my questions because of how quick everyone is to downvote and find reasons to take your question down than answer them. I don’t think they even consider what they read at all sometimes. 

I either scroll through questions made in the past to resolve my own code problems and if I really can’t find anything similar, I ask. But even then I either get no answer or I get shit on for it. I just got flack for asking a theoretical question about something I genuinely didn’t know was true or not because “theoretical questions don’t work here. We want code of which we can reproduce your errors. And because you didn’t provide code, then your question is worthless and unclear..” It was a question I spent a while googling to see if I can find an explanation online, but with the search being futile, I finally gave in and asked on SO. It is bs because I have stumbled onto many SO questions in that same vein before with very insightful answers that have helped me and a thousand others get some clarity on their confusion about certain concepts/theories. 


Thing was, I wasn’t asking people to fix my code, I was asking them whether general issue X has a correlation with general issue Y, and if yes, why, and if not, then tell me it doesn’t.  My question got closed soon after one salty downvoter said it wasn’t clear enough and that I needed to provide code, even though I was asking for an explanation of concept and not a solution for my specific code issues. Then he proceeded to  tell me that my question was not a good fit for the site. But really what it was was that he didn’t prefer answering questions like mine. Unfortunately, I can’t just disclose my code online because it’s work related and I’m not allowed to. And so all I really wanted was an explanation of whether something was or wasn’t possible to get some clarity on what I should be looking out for when I resolve the issues on my own. Like damn, don’t bring my question down with you just because it’s not your type or question when there’s someone else willing to teach me something!

Luckily was able to get an enlightening response from someone who took the time to explain to me what I was confused about before it got closed!!! The whole gatekeeping of answers in what could’ve been such a learning experience is so disappointing over there. It happens time and time again."

Also remember that people on the Internet are often jerks. The relative anonymity does that. Again, don't sweat it. If someone demonstrates that they're a jerk, they aren't worth your time and their opinion is not worth beans.

Once you learn a bit more you will understand the terminology better and your Google searches will yield better hits. But yes, Google is absolutely your friend.

Today, Google is so slick that I can ask a detailed question in plain English, and receive an accurate result. This wasn't possible until fairly recently.

What is the purpose of the gatekeeping now? If the question is not great, it won't get answered. I would rather have it sit there than be auto-closed.

SO is a karma farming simulator. Many of the answers aren't even the ""best"" answer. If you actually want to learn, it takes much less time, is much more helpful, provides a much better explanation, and is much more up to date to either peruse the documentation yourself or participate in a community dedicated to your language/platform/stack of choice, for example the Unity forums here or the official ones."

Yes, that’s the point u/dmazzoni was making. Once you’re past the absolute beginner stage, you will stop looking for exact solutions and try looking for problems that look slightly similar, or something that’s different, but the methods of solving them are similar. Then figuring out how to connect the dots and extract insight from those seemingly different answers may become a fun part of the problem-solving experience.

At least, that’s how I learned, and your methods of solving problems may be different, which is fine too. Good luck with your journey~ 😊"
86,TheTomato2,1647833768.0,12.0,"  Just don't be a [help vampire.](https://communitymgt.fandom.com/wiki/Help_Vampire) The problem is the way the internet works is that help vampires suck the life out of communities and then you are left with naive pseudo-beginners answering stuff and it becomes the blind leading the blind. I have seen it happen to a lot of subreddits. StackOverflow has it's issues but that is precisely what it is trying to avoid and it *has* to be that way or it just wouldn't work. You have to understand for every starry-eye-nothing-but-good-intentions-new-programmer asking basic questions there are 10 lazy students just trying to get people to do their homework for them.   

However, if you put in your due diligence and show that you put the work in people will want to help you. The thing is that 99% of your answers are one quick google away, so start learning how to google. If that fails, come here and ask your question and what you googled and what you found and you will 100% get a decent answer because experienced people won't feel like they are wasting their time on someone who just wants easy answers.  It's the effort that counts, not your brains or ability or w/e."

89,dmazzoni,1647830629.0,6.0,"Do you have any examples of questions that you think we're incorrectly closed as duplicates?

I'm sure some get closed incorrectly, but most of the time the problem is that the person is asking a vague question about a long code snippet, rather than narrowing it down and posting a minimal repro."
90,antiproton,1647850567.0,3.0,"> Unless you're asking the most basic of programming questions, aka beginner friendly ones, any question of sufficient complexity to qualify as non-beginner would have enough nuance to warrent it's own question.

That's demonstrably untrue. One of the core lessons of learning to code is that most specific problems can be generalized to a class of already solved problems. 

The issue here is that people want to be told the answer directly, like they're being tutored. That's not what SO is for, nor should it be.

SO is very good at collecting examples of types of problems, but it's on you to translate the example you find that's in the ballpark of your specific problem and modify it to make your required solution. 

Not all resources need to be for all people. There's absolutely no point in being bitter about that."
91,,1647859290.0,3.0,"> that'll be more helpful than telling them they're not cut for programming

I call bullshit on OP's claim that people there said ""Why are you even coding? Go flip burgers at McDonald's"" or ""Just die already and stop posting dumb questions here.""

I would like to see those posts before I take OP's word for it because I think he/she is lying. Behavior like that can and should be reported but I doubt any of this is true in the first place. If it is, I would like to see the posts so I can report them myself. Sure people can be a bit insensitive but nobody is going to tell you to kill yourself for asking a question."

97,b4ux1t3,1648557774.0,1.0,"That's not true at all.

Questions can be updated and edited, as can the answers. Questions can also be versioned, so you can find answers for a specific version of whatever thing you're working with. 

Not to mention, some things just don't change all that much. An answer about factory patterns is as correct today as it was ten years ago. MVC hasn't changed. The world of technology is constantly changing, to be sure...but those changes are often _additive_ not _mutative_. 

You're literally saying that the site is bad at the thing it's specifically been good at for over a decade. If it didn't work, it would not have lasted this long.

If you don't like it, don't use it, but don't try to say ""site bad because I don't like it"". That just makes you sound ignorant. The fact of the matter is that literally millions of people use it to great effect, and have been for a long time."
98,Miu_K,1647851735.0,7.0,"Then they downvote the same question, but it's Python 3. Frustrating indeed."
99,joleves,1647873411.0,1.0,"But there is no reputation requirement for answers, so with that same logic they're just useless because of low quality spam. 

Imo it should be the other way around. Answers should require more reputation than commenting. If comments are good then a good user will update their answer to include any useful comments. 

So currently if I see a mistake in an answer I can't point out 1 wrong line but I can post the same full answer with the 1 line fixed. How does that improve it for anyone? It just means people reading it will take longer to find the correct answer."

101,CuttlefishQuincunx,1647838133.0,-1.0,"Seeing as I just got downvoted, no I don't really have any constructive criticism to further offer. Why would I bother to do that to myself? This is why Stack is driving people away. At a certain point, the lure of perceived exclusivity is outweighed by the sting of being treated like shit.

I don't even like using the site to look up questions from Google. I'd rather go to any other credible site first. I don't like the snarkiness on the site, and I don't like to see others being treated with contempt.

Having systems in place that encourage people to treat each other badly is damaging your brand. It's really that simple. No one wants to help a site create content while being treated poorly. It can't be all about the quality of your product. User experience also matters, and that includes the experience of users who are also unpaid content creators.

Since Stack seems to take a selfish point-of-view, I will pose a selfish question. What's in it for me, as a potential Stack contributor, if contributing means to risk abuse? What do we get out of all of this?"
102,thefirelink,1647851761.0,2.0,"No doubt that even the most specific issue can be solved by breaking it down into a bunch of smaller problems.

However, unless you're casually browsing SO on a regular basis, you'll never amass enough general knowledge to do that synthesizing yourself unless you are already experienced enough to have run into a large subset of issues and have learned their solutions. And if you fall into that category, any issue you have is specific enough to warrant it's own question, because that specific issue, even though was probably asked before, would be nearly impossible to find.

The more you break down a problem into smaller ones, the more difficult it is to find a solution. 

If I am struggling to get a route to work in Mux or Slim or through some other arbitrary router, it could be the definition, the code in the function pointed to by the route, the nginx or apache settings, maybe your load balancer is stripping your POST query before it redirects from http to https. Point being, one simplified problem has a myriad of solutions. You might not even know that POST data gets stripped during a redirect. Maybe your middleware is acting up, but you copied the code and aren't even sure what that is. 

You will never find the solution to some of these on SO because the base question has been asked before and people on there would rather shut you down in the name of some arbitrary, dismissive mission statement about preserving some ridiculous integrity that is more important than helping people learn."
