20,shevy-ruby,1638888564.0,2.0,"Perhaps it is because they are in a niche situation now. Like COBOL, even though a zombie language, assumingly the jobs that still exist are decently paid.

Other explanations may be that many perl guys also use e. g. C. So then it's more a combination of languages. But it's not possible to speculate without knowing how these answers were given. I guess most use more than one programming language."

I know entire server ecosystems for multi-national companies that are fully reliant on Perl scripts to function. Yet over my 12year career, I've never come across someone who knows language X,Y,Z, **and** Perl. I guess Perl isn't an attractive choice as a 2nd language *for most developers*. I've only ever come across someone who is a dedicated Perl dev and they are few and far between. Seems like a similar situation to COBOL."

Not saying they aren't skilled just they have had bad experiences or working in another language is just more enjoyable.

A lot of places in the UK I knew that wrote/write perl are trying their best to move away due to recruitment issues which also leads to parts of the module eco system not being very up to date."

I suppose many of them are too green to opt into a developer's survey. I also understand that many experienced devs are just not represented in StackOverflow surveys but every possible statistic about this industry points to there being way more inexperienced devs purely because of how much growth its experiencing.

Most of the devs I've worked with personally here in Eastern Europe (which is having an IT boom) had less than 10 years experience, to a ratio of 15 to 1! It's probably lower in developed countries but still weighing on the side of inexperience."

*I know how to program*. Could I look at a new (to me) language and roughly understand it and modify it as needed? Probably. Could I scale-out said application to be performant, maintainable and future-proof? Definitely not.

I get where you're coming from in *knowing programming* which certainly helps but to suggest that would make you proficient/efficient in language X is a little far-fetched in the real world. It takes years to become truly proficient in a language."
