0,intercaetera,1628187920.0,24.0,Maybe once we surpass VBA people will actually start caring about us.
1,alchemistcamp,1628189912.0,17.0,"That's impressive, especially considering how much the Elixir Forum reduces our need for Stack Overflow."
2,infinite_inquiry,1628203028.0,10.0,"I really dislike how they always put JavaScript in these surveys multiple times.

JavaScript
TypeScript: superset of JavaScript
Node: JavaScript again"
3,SituationSoap,1628194920.0,7.0,"Worth remembering that for a lot of these more niche languages like Julia, Lisp, etc, the values that they're pulling are often from a really small number of participants. Usually a few dozen/couple hundred, so you're only getting the absolutely most passionate people answering for the more obscure languages.

The SO survey is great, but it kind of falls apart at the margins."
4,,1628228945.0,1.0,Dart almost as used as Ruby? Any Dart programmers in the house? Never met one.
5,lovebes,1628193117.0,5.0,Ah yes considering that it is impressive
6,siriguillo,1628197134.0,2.0,"Exactly, I have argued this multiple times and people do not believe me"
7,aloha2436,1628216734.0,11.0,"Typescript is a different language imho, but node being separate from javascript is just wrong and misleading."
8,mynewoldusername,1628197703.0,3.0,"You don't have to guess, they show the numbers: 1k for Julia and Lisp, 1.5k for Elixir."
9,JiriSpax,1628234899.0,2.0,I do Flutter apps on Android. Flutter is getting more popular all the time. It's a much more pleasant experience than using Kotlin or React Native. Ubuntu will switch for some apps to Flutter as well.
10,infinite_inquiry,1628264630.0,2.0,"I do see how separating TypeScript from vanilla JavaScript is useful in the survey, now that I think about it. It’s certainly helpful for tracking its growing adoption rate.

Edit: a word"
