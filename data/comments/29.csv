This is why you ask people whether they are better than the median programmer."

2,toramanlis,1555022238.0,2.0,The employees should see the mistakes I make.
3,Gold3nstar99,1555027472.0,3.0,To be fair people that bother to answer StackOverflow surveys likely are above average.
4,inetphantom,1555098136.0,1.0,Is the humorous intent somewhere in the comments?
5,hwuthwut,1555022420.0,4.0,Its also possible if the population that responds to surveys is not representative of general population.
6,toramanlis,1555022448.0,2.0,I think that's why they mention how may people took the survey. With this many people the distribution is most likely balanced. Otherwise they'd just say it's impossible rather than improbable regardless of how big the data is.
7,Nightmoon26,1555022142.0,1.0,I'm not really sure how you would calculate a mean... It's not like programming skill is easy to objectively quantify...
8,OdinGuru,1555026689.0,4.0,A agree. Programmers that use stack overflow > programmers that do not use stack overflow. Only question is how big is the inferior group.
