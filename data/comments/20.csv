The new MacBook Pro and the seeming abandonment of the Mac Pro in recent times means a _lot_ of developers are considering switching away this year.

I work with about 40 engineers, and all but 4 of them choose macOS as main dev platform both at work, and at home (side projects, etc.). 

Within a day of the new MBP announcement there was a spreadsheet going around showing specs on alternate dev machines from Dell, Razer, etc. and this was organised by a developer who leads our native application development team and has owned at least one machine from every generation of Apple from the original Mac Plus onwards.

The main problems are: the butterfly keyboard, which runs contrary to the main dev fashion for moving to cherry keys and mechanical keyboards, and which many devs don't like; the removal of the Esc key for the touch bar, which impacts devs who prefer to use vi or editors with vi keybindings; the massive price lift, especially in comparison to similar spec machines from other manufacturers; the soldered on SSD and RAM meaning upgradeability/repairability is capped; the hard limit on 16GB of RAM, which for a dev using Docker and running micro-services locally is now starting to look a little low, and so likely will be within 2-3 years; the fact Apple are pitching it for consumers based on chipset choices and timelines.

Apple spent a lot of time and money in the early days of OS X courting developers, particularly Unix developers. They are now chasing the consumer vision hard, and as a consequence, I'm expecting to see these numbers collapse hard in the next couple of years."

What a load. The 2016 MBP butterfly keyboard is closer to a mechanical keyboard in feel than any of the mushy 2012-2015 rMBP keys. I type on cherry MX blues on my PC desktop and this is the first MBP in a while that's been a pleasure to type on.

There are a large number of developers who don't need 32GB of RAM, who don't care about opening up their ultraportable notebook for upgrades, and who don't run a billion VMs. There are developers who benefit greatly from TB3 and USB-C.

The program, Seil.app was using to do this until recently. macOS 10.12.2 introduced a preference to do this without a third party program.
