Traditionally the main strengths of macOS were:
1) quality, top-of-the-line hw (although very expensive too) with very good battery life
2) very good sw availability (like MS Office, Photoshop)

Number 1 is mostly gone. Dell XPS and similar models are now as good or better than Apple hw. The last refresh of the Macbook Air/Macbook and the Macbook Pro lines are widely considered as failures and out-of-line with user expectations.

Number 2 is also eroding rapidly. While MS Office and PS are still not available natively for Linux, Office365 and other multi-platform / web applications are now available and good enough. Also, the native, open-source/free Linux application have come up in sophistication/stability/features so quite often you just start using an alternative (like iMovie --> KDEnlive).

Also, for web development, practically Linux is the native platform (since the deployment platform will also be Linux) one can reduce development/deployment friction by simply moving to a Linux desktop.

2 the most used distributions Debian,Ubuntu,Mint,Fedora have a corresponding server version so it may be that most web developers will use a distro that matches the server for familiarity sake, 
If flatpack/snap land that will give same boost to major distro too not only the smaller ones, I imagine it would be possible to install via flatpack/snap s table dev environment, a bleeding edge/experimental one, an older environment if you need it for maintaining older apps(this is possible now too but it would be made easier on all distros) my point is that setting up dev encironment from the distro repository is not a major advantage, usually you setup the environment yourself and grab dependencies with the built in tool of the dev platform(ex npm,composer,cargo...)"

and 60% of C++ development is done on non-Windows platforms. So, I'd go so far as to say it's very unlikely that you are correct.

I will point out a counterpoint though. The top 5 programming languages via Jetbrains research seems more realistic from my experience, and that puts C# as the second most popular language. Of these, four *can* be developed on Windows. I'd still bet that most Javascript development isn't done on Windows at all, and Java development definitely isn't in Visual Studio.

I know startups are using  latest tech(go,rust,....) and node is getting popular in smaller shops too. But most developers are working on smaller problems, and they do not get the decision what tech to use, usually you get to maintain and improve existing project. There are also small projects, like you have a desktop app, and you want to add a ""report bug/Send feedback"" button,  the company has already a WP blog with PHP/mysql(it could be a mysql alternative) so you the simplest solution is to write 1 php file, get the data posted into it, log the feedback in the db, and email it also to a feedback email, (so 1 file, no framerworks ,dependencies, transpiling/compiling what I meant was that LAMP and now node is used in tons of places that are under the radar, but I did not intended to upset people that use other tools,   I am not in loved with my tools and if a different one including Windows is better I would use it."
91,pooper-dooper,1490282052.0,1.0,"I imagine it's also a function of my small-time use of Rust. If I were working on a larger, multi-module project, it's possible I'd want something deeper. On the other hand, it's not like Java where you have to create a file for every public type, so refactoring is possible with simple text manipulation. Although I do think it's best to use dedicated-for-purpose tools for refactors, because we've all been in that situation where text search/replace is insufficient or over-eager (and hence a bit tedious)."
92,simion314,1490202542.0,2.0,"Do you know people that use Visual Studio for PHP?I would not install VS for PHP, if I have to have it install(for some c# projects) then maybe I would use it instead of grabbing other IDE like Netbeans/Eclipse/PHPStorm "
93,Deviltry1,1490200954.0,0.0,"It's not about popularity or what supports what. Visual Studio (working with C#) + plugins is the best IDE experience in the world. Better than IntelliJ IDEA working with Java, even though Java is of course more popular language."
94,xiaomiao_de_belgerac,1490289517.0,2.0,"Refactors all exist in Rust, they are just command line tools.

Did you know that internally rustc actually translates the entire crate to a single text file before compilation?"
95,uep,1490205289.0,1.0,"That's a good point. I made the distinction about Java, but even though I think a lot of PHP development is done on Windows, I doubt it is done in Visual Studio. Anecdotal, but none of the PHP developers I know use it."
96,simion314,1490203222.0,3.0,"Have you used both? I remember when I did C# I was using Resharper so Essentially I was using Intellij inside VS.  The debugger works similar in both IDEs,Intellij has tons of plugins(I  use git then I can commit, push, create PR,check diffs, revert with a keyboard shortcut, mysql integration is great, it can read your db and it will spot if you use wrong column names(I use SQL statements with bound parameters instead of ORM functions in most places, a gitignore plugin, plugins for other languages like TypeScript,Scala... )
I respect your opinion that VS is a very good IDE, I am just wondering what do you think is the best thing that VS does it and is missing in IDEA. If you are doing C# then when the new IDE for C# will be ready you could  try the trial, but I am sure it is not easy to change your IDE, and you should not change it if is working good  for you in the end is just a piece of software."

No. And hell to the no when you install https://www.oz-code.com/"
100,simion314,1490205157.0,1.0,"Can you tell me what are your favorite features of this debugger? I can't do a comparison with Intellij one for Java since I do not use Java, I used C# and VS a few years ago and I wish to know what useful things this debugger adds(nothing interesting jumps at me from the page). Hovering over vars in IDEA also shows the values, you can add watchers with expressions, but as I said my experience is withJS and PHp Sdebug in latest years, I liked .NET but MS refused to make it crossplatform until it was too late and now we have to use JS"
