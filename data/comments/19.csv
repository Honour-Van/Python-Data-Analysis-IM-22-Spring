2,Freonr2,1554833420.0,13.0,"Python and Tensorflow seem to be exploding.  Very surprised to see such large numbers for them.  

TF seems to be the clear and dominant future of ML, and it seems Python is the dominant language for it, but I imagine Python is gaining elsewhere as I'm not sure ML is enough to push it so broadly."

4,,1554830084.0,10.0,"> The related roles and disciplines of site reliability engineering and DevOps are somewhat new, but the people working in this field are highly experienced.

This is probably the biggest factor in being content. Those filling DevOps roles are highly experienced, long time tech professionals and probably have a lot of leeway and a hefty salary to boot. Having to answer a phone call a week during off hours for that level of stability and benefits is something a senior is willing to do."
5,HPCPHD,1554850789.0,6.0,"Stack overflow surveys are a statistical joke.

There are 3.9 million tech workers in the US and they surveyed 25k which would be okay except.... The sample is 100% not at random. Every statistic from the survey is biased then.

Who honestly thinks ""rust"" is the top ""loved"" language!

And 66% of people are ""above average"" skills which is statistically impossible."

8,Frodolas,1554830310.0,50.0,"> This is statistically unlikely

I'm surprised Stack Overflow doesn't have a basic understanding of statistics. This would only be statistically unlikely if the sample was random, as it would then approximate a normal distribution. In this case, an online survey is basically a convenience sample, that too with tons of non-response and selection bias.

It is very possible that the developers that use Stack Overflow and response to this survey are all above average, since there are 4 *million* developers in the US alone."

16,Rymasq,1554916499.0,1.0,interesting cause I've worked in two different roles now dealing with production up time and site reliability and honestly a lot of companies are willing to let more junior folks handle this sort of role. Especially with the rise of cloud because it makes it so easy to troubleshoot machines and reboot and perform administrative tasks.
17,TimeWaitsFNM,1554949321.0,1.0,"DevOps is definitely paying well and very hard to find people capable. You really need to understand not only dev but how to handle infrastructure as well. In my experience it rare for someone to have both passions.

22,PuppySlayer,1554832312.0,31.0,"80% saying they code as a hobby is quite telling, imho. 

Depending on how strict we are about the definition of coding as a hobby, I would argue pretty much none of the people I know actually do that."
23,Vok250,1554837173.0,19.0,"That statement also completely ignores the *Competence and Experience* graph right below, which partially explains the results. Even when you tell people to account for their experience, most people will not be able to ignore that factor. Experienced devs consider themselves above-average because they are. Compared to a peer with equally experience, they may not be, but most humans don't respond to surveys that way.

Also, the age curve of people who responded centers around 25 years old, yet the average experience in western countries is 13-15 years. Either we all start developing professionally in our early teens or their data has some wild sampling biases and outliers.

Data is hard. Human surveys and basic averages are pretty much useless in the academic world. They make great blog posts though."

I mean there are areas in the world where the social net is just flat out bad but then that means you're reaching countries that have no formal laws on employment in general.
