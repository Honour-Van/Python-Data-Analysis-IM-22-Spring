17,K3yz3rS0z3,1653211814.0,1.0,"Wasn't there an ""on the fly"" theme choosing feature for a while? Even for logged off visitors. I remember something like that, few months ago, and it just lasted maybe few weeks.

Edit : t'was April Fools 2022 and it was fucking amazing. Why don't they just keep it around? At least just a dark mode? They released the feature already. Why taking it back?"
18,banmedaddy12345,1653165138.0,32.0,I use Dark Reader.  It has some good options to help you customize how you want things.  For instance some websites you don't want to have dark mode on and so you can individually toggle it.  You can change the font and colors of the website simply as well.

30,Houdinii1984,1653175644.0,13.0,"\+1 for dark reader. The only time it doesn't work is when there is code forcing colors or pictures, and since we're in a coding sub, anything that doesn't work can have manual rules written. 

Heres a link to the official page: [https://darkreader.org/](https://darkreader.org/)"
31,nouseforareason,1653184968.0,5.0,"+2 for dark reader.  Has some issues with Confluence (especially draw.io plugin), and a couple other sites but it’s pretty solid and stops the constant dark mode / annoying mode sites that chromium can’t figure out are an issue thing."
