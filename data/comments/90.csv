0,Atulin,1636480978.0,35.0,Anything by JetBrains
1,Shishpt,1636480247.0,8.0,For me it’s neovim minimal flexible and fast
2,Shubham_Garg123,1636552504.0,7.0,VS Code
3,dihalt,1636490358.0,4.0,"PhpStorm, Goland, AppCode"
4,LarboLarboLarbo,1636501379.0,4.0,I love Atom.  Simple efficient and the git integration is *chefs kiss*
5,,1636547987.0,3.0,I use Sublime 3 but I think it's more out of familiarity and having a pretty decent workflow and pipeline built using it for the various project I am involved with.
6,Czepcon,1636540429.0,6.0,"Only choice is Visual Studio Code + addons + obviously coopilot. Things like, jetbrains stuff are uneceserry then. Also, others are really sloow."
7,n9iels,1636498466.0,2.0,"For me it depends on the language. I'm currently working on a big Angular project and I really like Visual Studio Code with the Angular extension pack and some more.

However I also did Java and PHP. For those languages Intellij en PhpStorm are just the best."
8,RotationSurgeon,1636568625.0,2.0,"IDE? Visual Studio (**not** Visual Studio Code), because we're a C# shop.

Editor? *vim*"
9,studzy_kaplash,1636572349.0,1.0,"I mostly use VSCode, but I do appreciate IDEs by JetBrains"
10,MizmoDLX,1636587674.0,1.0,"Intellij IDEA. Working with angular and spring boot and it's  great for both. But it feels like it's getting slower with recent updates... Hope they'll focus more on performance and bug fixes in feature updates.

I really want to love vs code for front end work. It's looking nice and it's fast. But always going back to intellij after a short time. Just too many things missing.... But it's just an editor after all"
11,,1636497129.0,7.0,"PHPStorm has made my life so much easier. It sounds crazy saying that, but it's a game changer for workflow."
12,MathAndMirth,1636484325.0,7.0,Yep. I shelled out for WebStorm and don't regret it a bit.
13,terranumeric,1636554121.0,1.0,"Main reason I use PHPStorm: the local history.

The plugins VSCode has for local history are just not as good as Jetbrains local history.

And I use it alot. Nothing better than reverting files after coding bullshit for an hour or two.

&#x200B;

And my employer pays. Developers are pretty cheap with stuff we need. Good hardware and minimal amount of software that costs money.  Basically nothing else. Other jobs have way more expensive running costs."
14,SuperMeteorite,1636597777.0,1.0,That’s a text editor not IDE unless you did some crazy stuff lol
15,Fun-Establishment368,1636513258.0,5.0,Yeah I like VS Code but I wish it had a git integration like Atom.
16,simplexityza,1636559725.0,2.0,"Yes, totally agree on this."
17,LowB0b,1636579908.0,1.0,vim is def the best out there for quick'n'dirty edits
18,Sphism,1636503011.0,3.0,"Totally agree. I used to use various apps for Web dev and now I use just php storm and it does everything... Excellent for writing code, great database ui, great git diffs, inline git blame, create pull requests in the ui, terminal, great with xdebug, todo's all in one place, file structure sometimes handy, some code macros for repetitive tasks, I love the shelf when I'm half way through something and need to do urgent fixes on something else. One click Npm installs are nice when re visiting an old site or installing a new one."
19,exscalliber,1636512687.0,2.0,"I love php storm even though I use none of the functionality that it features. VS code is great, but I think PHPstorm is just that much better. Also auto generating  code for repetitive things like getters and setters is super helpful. XDebug is also integrated really well once you have it set up and its probably one of the better debuggers I've used. PHPstorm is also pretty nice for html and js."
20,bluntfitness,1636497070.0,5.0,Paid Jetbrains products are 100% worth it
21,Shishpt,1636605755.0,1.0,"Yeah that's true, its become my everything :)"
22,RotationSurgeon,1636580045.0,1.0,I’ve never found anything I could work more quickly with once I was past the learning curve.
