2,reddit_time_waster,1650906368.0,14.0,The stack was still only half empty at that point.

4,ReformedSaladDodger,1650910627.0,10.0,"I know this is a joke, but as a genuine old fart, computers were a lot simpler back in the day - a couple of manuals and off you go - it’s hard to get too lost when you’re basically limited to vanilla C with a splattering of inline assembly when you needed real speed!"
5,BenkiTheBuilder,1650909251.0,9.0,I remember the time before StackOverflow. We used to cast bones and read the clouds. And let's not forget pig entrails. Pig entrails work especially well for questions related to C.
6,Huesan,1650903959.0,7.0,It just exists

8,molly_sour,1650908996.0,6.0,back at my first job there was only one computer in the office that had access to the internet and we had to take turn in using it to check emails or look for documentation...

12,scottamus77,1650912099.0,3.0,I like to imagine that it just appeared one day when no one was looking. Perhaps one day it may disappear in the same fashion and our society will crumble without our savior
13,tjackadams,1650912448.0,3.0,Some rumours going around that stack overflow existed before the big bang.
14,Knut_Knoblauch,1650914634.0,3.0,Obviously they used the correct standard calling notation as to not corrupt the stack while programming it.
15,Wizywig,1650915285.0,3.0,"I used to have a book on sql with a billion stickies. Every time I had weird questions on sql I had like 5 stickies I could reference. There were actually more books, asktom which showed interesting techniques.

Overall programming was so much harder back then because if you didn't know something you often had to read three books. It made things real slow.

This isn't necessarily a ""programmers were smarter"" statement. It's more along the lines of ""programming was far more time consuming than it needed to be, and a much higher barrier to entry"""
16,warrior_zz,1650903596.0,5.0,must have been a supernatural power
17,a_shadylady,1650904738.0,4.0,It was made by actual professionals who know what they are doing and don't rely on other people to write the code for them.

20,Coffee422,1650908117.0,2.0,"Time travelers!

They must have time travelled in future and then made posts about it on stackoverflow, reddit etc, atleast that's what I would've.......

WAIT A MINUTE.."
21,RoelRoel,1650912138.0,2.0,They had to scroll all the way down all the time on expertsexchange
22,,1650912716.0,2.0,They asked the questions directly via email

I'm sure it was made entirely with PHP or a similar high-level language, by people who wished they worked on bare metal."
25,qyxa,1650923401.0,2.0,Good one
26,UneergroundNews,1650924288.0,2.0,Using stack standardflow
27,infugia,1650925561.0,2.0,"What came first, stack overflow or the development of stack overflow?"

30,Yesterpizza,1650926337.0,2.0,"Yup.

As technology advances, there are more and more layers of it, and any given developer is writing far less of the code they're actually executing. 

It's impossible to actually understand their whole stack anymore.

That said, I don't think senior programmers use stack overflow 1/1000th of what this subreddit would have you believe."
31,kerepof199,1650920143.0,3.0,"Exactly, always has been."
32,DOGGYYY0311,1650914277.0,1.0,Also before the queem?

35,killea57,1650989106.0,1.0,Recursion
36,33498fff,1650907082.0,4.0,I think it's pretty humorous that we all rely on it instead of coming up with every single line of code ourselves
37,a_shadylady,1650914176.0,2.0,"If the name were accurate then I'd expect this place to have a lot more people who are actually experienced / knowledgeable about programming. Relying on code other people have written such as ISAs, toolchains, environments, and libraries is all fine and normal. What I take issue with is the idea that it's fine to directly use someone else's code as a substitute for your own."
38,Busy_Ice7264,1650909205.0,1.0,And it has been working out flawlessly
