If I'm writing something that's indented a few levels, I want to press tab a few times, not hammer the space bar 30 times. If my IDE treats those tab presses as multiple spaces, that's fine by me."

13,CliffordAlgebra,1497574791.0,13.0,They get paid more because they produce more value for the company. If you're writing a novel algorithm your ugly code can still be highly valuable because no one else does what you do and that generates value. For normal business code (what most people write) being heavily readable generates a LOT of value in saved time down the road and no amount of cleverness can make up for that because the problem is inherently boring.

I personally like my spaces since they let me format things more precisely when a line needs to wrap, but that's an aesthetic choice and there's no evidence that that actually improves readability."

53,prophase25,1497590306.0,11.0,"lol think about it this way. Every modern day programmer worth his or her weight has picked up an insane amount of google-fu: if the programmer is confronted with a problem, he or she will google it before thinking about it 9 times out of 10. When someone asks a question by typing it, the average programmer probably thinks to him or herself and says, ""hey, you know, if you had just searched exactly what you had asked me, you'd have your answer"". That was a not-so-subtle reminder that this won't be your last question, and that redditor won't be around to answer the next one. "

65,jaxklax,1497584591.0,1.0,"Indeed, these days I just don't do alignment. Your example is a good one, and I'm often tempted to align in similar situations (mainly C struct initialization and other grouped initialization). I guess you could do something like this:

	long_parameter_name =>
		1,
	short_name =>
		2

...but I don't deny that takes up a lot of vertical space. I would probably just not align the values.
