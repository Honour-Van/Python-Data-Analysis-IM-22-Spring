10,Blazing1,1651619024.0,2.0,I here podcasts. They take a lot of hours to say something I could read in 10 minutes.
11,abeuscher,1651529897.0,167.0,"I personally find it hard to stay in a job just for the money. I am in one right now that is pretty tricky in this respect. On the one hand - great - I can save a certain amount and I don't have to worry about what stuff costs as much as I might. On the other hand there probably should be more to life than just doing whatever you're told for the highest bidder. So far my decision has been to stick it out, wait for options to vest, keep my head to the ground. But it is very hard to keep doing it day after day when I have no control over any of the decisions made above me and am regularly thrown under the bus for the mistakes of others. Neither of those affect the pay, though, which is the most I've made in my life.

No one ever got rich off a salary. Is a truth I have tried to internalize in my 40's after having been lied to for most of my young life. I am not there yet but it sure seems truer and truer every year. And if it is then I am not sure what I am doing.

Strong advice to any juniors reading this - try and be part of something you care about. It makes it easier to wake up in the morning as you get older."

Painful."
17,tsevni,1651539418.0,11.0,"The way I see it, I feel I am at my best when I am working towards getting comfortable with being very uncomfortable. Most of us know we should be exercising more - but it's those who actually push through the discomfort that reap the benefits much later in life. To me, this fact holds true about work as well.

Like most difficult truths in life, simply knowing is not enough - it really comes down to execution.

It's pretty uncomfortable waking up day in and day out knowing full well that I am not in control of the bulk of my time and energy for the day because I am selling my time to the highest bidder and offloading decisions to middle managers. 

But as uncomfortable as this may be, it's still more comfortable than taking that leap of faith into the unknown - a leap towards a future where I am potentially in total control of myself, my decisions, my consequences, my time. This is where I believe people build multi-generational wealth and are able to contribute to their communities on a much larger scale.

I am in my early 30's and I have failed to break the salary cycle a few times now, but with each failure, I always learn something new about myself and I gain more confidence in my success tomorrow - if can I just push through the discomfort today."

27,Skyopp,1651589556.0,3.0,"I think we're just really lazy. If you can save a good amount of your salary and live comfortably, not feel overworked or too stressed, you have it good.

Most people I've ever met make less and work longer than I do."

If you stay below your means and save(invest in low cost ETFs like VOO) consistently, in 20 years you can become a multi-millionaire via compound interest. I know several who have done just this working regular white collar jobs. I know a teacher that did this over 25 years."

34,abeuscher,1651594449.0,4.0,"I grew up in a very privileged situation as a scholarship kid and was raised by people who work for the ultra wealthy. My old man lived on Nantucket and I grew up there and one of the wealthier suburbs outside of Boston. So when I say rich I mean never having to ask how much.

Not saying that should necessarily be the goal of anyone's life. I'm not even sure people should ever have that much money. But it is what I mean by rich."

I want to eat sushi, go on international vacations, buy organic beef and an electric car and sustainable toilet paper and I surely can't do that AND save enough to retire in 20 years. I wonder how many people who say they saved and retired in 20 years have done poor math on how much life is going to cost for the remainder of their time cause last I read it was near double digit millions to retire and not have to work another day."

45,CurrentMagazine1596,1651581334.0,9.0,"I've worked in other industries and no, tech isn't that great tbh. It's much better than manual labor, but almost any white collar job is better than manual labor.

Devs have a distorted view of how little work most administrative stuff actually do. I had a previous job doing bookkeeping for a local municipality - there are swathes of government workers that literally do nothing all day but make the occasional powerpoint and sign paperwork. Software is much more difficult and mentally taxing than many white collar jobs."

Also, there’s flawed thinking with your criticism. You chose the teacher example to criticize but that’s not good faith because the teacher was never going to afford the lifestyle you described regardless of their savings rate. So really, your point is moot."
