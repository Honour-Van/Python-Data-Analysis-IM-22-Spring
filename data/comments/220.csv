1,LittleTeaFlower,1653409977.0,3.0,"Thank you so much for this! I could never tell the difference between n log n and just log n. I'll probably be getting a book on Data Structures and Algorithms later because I feel so deprived of what WGU gave us, but this is great to start! Thanks :)"

7,prettysenshi,1653449070.0,1.0,"Definitely this. I may not understand it completely, but this book helped me get through Data Structures and Algorithms I. I fully plan on re-reading it and educating myself further once I'm done with my degree."
8,LittleTeaFlower,1653410370.0,5.0,"If you're truly interested, it seems they may be talking about this one: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-big-o-notation/ 

It seems good, but I haven't dived too deep into this one yet, so I hope it is of some use to viewers!"
