10,,1554846326.0,79.0,"I'm beginning to get frustrated with the Python community. Coming from the Java/.Net world I gave up trying to understand why they are so confident duck typing is better than static typing. I thought maybe I was just too old and set in my ways. That's what I was being told anyway.

But now type annotations are here and I am confused again. At first it seemed like the die hard Python coders didn't think they were necessary which is what I expected. But now that Pythonic ""explicit is better than implicit"" seems to be suggesting that, actually, annotations are necessary. Not only that but they should be enforced by the linter...

So now I'm supposed to believe that a type checking system that's been tacked on is not only necessary but somehow still better than those languages that built type checking into the design from day one?

But then there's this...

* Windows - 47.4%
* MacOS - 26.8%

So you fucked up the question, and didn't control for the fact that everyone is going to evaluate themselves against everyone they know, because the human brain doesn't categorize in tidy groups based on years experience. The last time people had a significant sample set of their age-level peers was in college, because that is all they knew. As soon as you enter the workforce, you're a fool if you *don't* feel imposter syndrome (or you were hired beneath your aptitude).

They also didn't consider the fact that as one gets older, they're still comparing themselves against the industry as a whole, but the less competent side has been dropping out of the industry over time.

It's been brought up before and usually everyone looks at me like I'm insane when I say that I like to go home and work on my own stuff, and considering that my own projects are in a language I typically don't work in in the office (but we use) I often surprise people who do work on those when I start jumping in on pull requests and calling out poorly designed code in a language I never work in for work itself.

It's such a foreign concept. I got into programming because I like it, not because it provides me a paycheck. In all honesty, I think it's a huge separator between developers. I really feel like programming is a field that, while you can do it at an acceptable level without that spark, to have it often results in you excelling far above those that don't. When you enjoy what you do, it's really easy to do it well."

116,SirWusel,1554830950.0,78.0,"First of all, I remember last year, people posted the actual numbers of votes for Rust, and it was relatively low. So not many people voted for it, but almost all who did, did so favorably.

I follow several extremely experienced C++ developers on Twitter (people like John Carmack, Johnathan Blow, Richard Geldreich, etc etc) and they all seem pretty frustrated with C++ and its ecosystem. Johnathan is even going as far as developing his own language (Jai). My perception is that for a lot of them, Rust is the first modern language that can actually be used in domains were previously, there was no feasible way around C++. So I guess it's very exciting for a lot of developers who are tired of working with these old, messy languages.

Apart from that, it's just a pretty interesting language, no matter which field you come from. I worked through most of the official Rust book and during that time, I didn't create a single bug (that I know of). Everything was caught by the compiler. Granted, I didn't write very complex software, but still, it was fascinating.

That being said, my personal opinion about Rust is, that it's way too difficult to read. I definitely want to invest more time into it once I'm a more competent developer, but for someone of my experience level, some of that code is just pure madness (though the same goes for C++). Where I work, I would probably get my PR rejected if I used more than one generic type, but in Rust I more than once encountered three. And on top of this, add explicitly marked lifetimes and \`where\` clauses and suddenly trait or impl definitions look like ancient hieroglyphs."
117,lazyear,1554846935.0,15.0,"I've been programming for over a decade with experience in ~10 different languages and Rust is my favorite by far. 

It strikes a really nice balance between functional and imperative programming.  

  Pattern matching and static types are amazing when writing any kind of complicated code. It's extremely performant, and can be quite easy to parallelize safely.  

Also cargo and crates.io are fantastic. Overall, I just find programming in Rust much easier than python when it comes to anything complicated, due to the ease of building a mental model of my programs expected behavior"
118,MiloTodt,1554847990.0,12.0,"The community around it is excellent. There's an assumed level of competency for people looking to use it which allows materials to be written for people who already know at least something about coding. The compiler provides excellent informative error messages (a blessing from C/C++) and the compiler is so strict that if your code compiles it'll likely work exactly as intended.

Outside of directly flagging sections of your code as Unsafe, it's pretty much impossible to do things like running out of bounds, or writing to unallocated memory, or having data/resource races.  Those are issues that in a language like C++ are incredibly difficult to anticipate, debug, isolate, or reproduce.

&#x200B;

In addition, the way Rust forces you to code is in way that forces you to adhere to well understood best practices for coding in general- especially mutability/multi-threading. Once you get the hang of Rust, you feel far safer in the understanding of what your code is going to actually /do/. While I've never used Rust in a professional project, I find working in it teaches me to be a much better coder in general as the way Rust forces me to code also lends to best practices in other languages."

Something that hasnt been mentioned here yet is cargo, rusts package manager. I'd go so far as to say it's as good as npm.

The cheapest form of energy is energy that would otherwise be wasted. The only form of energy that gets wasted is renewable energy. Think about it, coal and oil don't go to waste but excess solar, wind, and hydro electricity go to waste because of our inability to profitably store it. Many huge bitcoin mining players are taking advantage of this by moving their operations to the source and using the excess electricity that would otherwise be wasted thus creating extra revenue streams for the renewable energy producers. The best part is that miners that do this will be more profitable because of their access to cheap electricity and thus will expand their operation and force competing miners to find access to cheaper electricity.

 * If you use it like C then whilst it might genuinely be a better C, it fails to solve memory issues. i.e. it's missing a garbage collector.

That is a paradox. Traditionally a paradox that cannot be solved.

Now sure you could mix and match. That's fine. But give those two statements to a die hard C++ developer and 1) they don't want a GC, and 2) they already have a better C.

So those two statements stayed as a paradox. Until Rust. AFAIK Rust is the first mainstream language to solve this problem. It is garbage collected and as fast as C++ at the same time. That said stuff like 'modern C++' also solves it, it just solves it with the baggage of C++ (which means it doesn't really solve it because I can circumvent modern C++).

D also has a wider perception issue to native developers due to the inclusion of the words 'garbage collector'. Even if it's never even used. It has a perception issue for Java developers (and similar) because of the words 'better C'. i.e. manual memory management. It's like the worst of both worlds.

As such, some of my thicker concrete objects implement 4-8 interfaces. I don't actually _care_ about the interface as a first-class citizen though, you know? What I _actually_ want to be able to do is define a function that takes in a parameter that isn't a predefined interface, but just a collection of methods and properties that I care about. In C#, you can do something like...

    public int Foo<T>(T fooParam) where T: ICountProperties

Where `ICountProperties` is, say, defined as

    public interface ICountProperties
    {
        int PropertyCount { get; }

Right, the most popular frameworks however use MVC or some variation of it and that's what's usually taught. It's much easier to start with PHP where you just rename html file to php and add php code to it and it just works. You don't need to restart your project every time you change things, you just save the php file and it's updated. It's extremely beginner-friendly.

> And PHP is a really badly designed language and it's dying. 

There are definitely bad parts about PHP and pitfalls beginners can fall into, so at some point you realise it's only beginner friendly on the surface. And there are many people who never do and that's what always skews the salaries. Once you're proficient with it however, that difference goes away.

423,CodingCraig,1554855512.0,53.0,"To quote a couple lines from my paper, ""Ultimately, the research conducted in this paper points to a much larger and critical problem with electronic voting in general: even if a protocol is theoretically secure, there is no guarantee or way to effectively prove that the system used for voting is in fact implementing the protocol correctly and has not been compromised."" Thus while we can often make strong guarantees around the security of a chosen implementation, it is impossible to guarantee that the correct implementation is being used, or used correctly. Even if we employ a third party to verify this, how can we guarantee that this third party is honest?

With blockchain based voting specifically, you could either use a private or public blockchain, the former theoretically being more difficult to manipulate and easier to verify publicly. The problem that arises is that we would need to allow the voter to verify that their vote has been cast and captured correctly in the blockchain, but this then allows the voter to reveal his vote to others (and selling of votes becomes an issue). The blockchain-based approach also doesn't provide a solution to compromised voting machines. If the machine is compromised, it could get you to vote for an option you didn't select. Even if you can verify your vote was recorded incorrectly by inspecting the blockchain, it becomes tricky for the voting authority to handle such claims (and as mentioned earlier, the ability to verify your vote leads to the potential to sell votes).

Ultimately, it's a viable solution for non-critical votes, but for critical votes (such as national elections) it just doesn't offer the same security as tradiitonal ballot-box voting - a flaw in an electronic voting system can make it just as easy to manipulate 10 000 votes as it is to manipulate one. This is not the case in physical voting systems. 

Interestingly, this isn't just theoretical. There have been numerous studies that have looked at the security of electronic voting systems and they are often found to be seriously lacking in security."

In Bitcoin, this means thousands of independent workers. And we've argubly already seen how worker pools have concentrated that power into just a few bigger entities. 

For voting, who is determining consensus? Who is determining proof of work? Proof of stake?

There's your weakness. And I'd add that the inscrutability of the system makes it so, if it were compromised, there would be no way to know."

B) They were marked as shipped and shipped to the correct destination but were stolen en route.  
C) They were marked as shipped, shipped to the correct destination, and arrived but were never marked as received.

Already we have no more information than we did before using conventional methods. We also don't know if in the case of A or C if it was simple oversight or something more nefarious.

As far as life outside of work being none of your employers business, I mostly agree. Most things about people's lives are and should stay private. But this is a behavioral interview we're talking about. Maybe you have the work history to support never talking about a side project, but most candidates I interview don't. If they want to differentiate themselves (especially students) they need to describe their passion in more than just theoretical terms. They need to tell me what they've done. In my experience, some of the coolest work people do is in hobby projects and most people respond very positively to being given a chance to show it off a little. 

That being said, if someone was uncomfortable talking about hobby projects, I would simply ask what project at work they initiated without being asked. It gets similar information, but I've found people love talking about their hobby projects and I'd rather hear some passion about something they like than an unenthusiastic presentation of something they did to try to impress their boss (or because they had to to pass the class).

One last point I'd make is that programming, like most fields, requires practice. So if someone is practicing outside of work, that's reason to believe they might be better at their job (which is my job to determine during an interview).

Unfortunately, I don't see any way to guarantee that these tokens would stay synchronized with their items. And while I can't speak to the underground watch market, I'm fairly confident there's a market for cheap cars among criminals who don't particularly care where said cars came from.

Yeah, but the government keeps track of all of this already.  That's the issue.  This system is in the walled garden, and the government needs to synchronize with a bunch of different entities in order to pass title. That's why there are people who buy a car, then end up going to jail one night when they get pulled over.  Which is ridiculous, since the government stamps the title on the car with no real authority at all.

Let me give you an example.  When I bought my house, I needed to tell the government that the title was transferred to me.  But even though its recorded in the registrar, it actually doesn't mean anything since they can't use it as validation that I actually own the title because they can't verify chain of custody.  Someone could walk up to my house, knock on the door and say, ""what are you doing in my house?""  The only recourse I have is to fight it in court, despite the government ""validating"" the transfer and transaction. 

That's what block chain is great at: chain of custody.  

>The tax evasion example is where I really don't see your thought process. From where I'm standing, blockchain will make the problem worse, not better. How does the IRS (or your country's equivalent) figure out how much you owe in taxes when you squirrel away all your income into anonymous cryptocurrency accounts?

Blockchain systems are tiered.  Ethereum uses a good example.  Think of the currency as oil, the raw product. 

The raw product is anonymous.  But refining this into another product, can mean lots of different things.  So we can take this oil, and refine it into a good that doesn't have the anonymity, despite the underlying network having anonymity. 

So we could take ETH, refine it into USD token with an authentication and authorization layer, and when someone gets paid in USD token, taxes are automatically taken out based on smart contract logic.  We build the tax code directly into the currency.

This is essentially what's already happening, except its a flimsy system using a single token (SSN), and some loose security rules.  A system could be made that's obviously better than this, with multi-factor auth with different levels of privilege depending on how many keys are required to execute a task. 

For instance, transfer 1000 dollars - 1 key. 

Transfer 1 million dollars - 8 keys.  

This is infinitly more secure than ssn and birthdate.  And those keys can be dynamically changed unlike SSN."

Then you cherry pick one reason to trust USD. There are plenty of reasons to trust USD and there are plenty for bitcoin, and they're different. For example, bitcoin is a commodity currency rather than fiat, which means no party can create new bitcoins or remove bitcoins from others. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are trustless systems, whereby eachparty need not trust any other single entity, such as a central bank, in order to use the currency. This is huge - you can operate sensibly in a world where you think everyone is your enemy, with no central arbiter. This could be used, for example, to do international interbank settling.

This, again, makes no sense. The ""ability to tax"" says nothing about the value of a currency in itself. The value of a currency is determined by a whole range of influences.

But honestly, many of my designs as I have gotten more into Rust have used less explicit lifetimes and reference counting. I now prefer other means than don't have references all over the place. For instance, using unique IDs and a lookup table."
679,czipperz,1554851593.0,6.0,"Correct.  In C++ and Rust you have RAII.  C++ uses destructors, and Rust has those too (it calls it [drop](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html)).

To use reference counting in C++, you wrap a type in `shared_ptr`.  In Rust you wrap it in [`Rc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html) or [`Arc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html).  Both default to not using reference counting, both are opt in.

My comment about correctness is stating that in Rust, it requires you to have memory safety and prove that your code will always have memory safety.  This leads to a pattern of wrapping types in reference counting, but it is not required.  In C++, the same pattern occurs when the code is carefully thought about, but often times, because the compiler doesn't require strict memory safety, it isn't done."
