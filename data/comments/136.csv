LOL, really?  Don't spend 5 minutes lecturing us for not spending more of our free time ass-kissing and doing IT training and then claim to have any interest in a true work life balance.  Why do we keep internalizing the failings of management?  It's killing us trying to meet and exceed the unrealistic expectations that most companies project on technical folks.

> it is okay to walk away from job offers.

This is true, why did you have to bury the lead.

EDIT:

It's the abusive boyfriend problem, you can't solve the problems of management, they will not learn from within.  There are plenty of companies that you can have a work-life balance at and maybe your salary won't be in the top 5% but you won't be worked to death.  In these companies you will find great benefits, good teams, work that isn't batshit insane but you may not find a lot of room for growth.  I do move the company forward by earning new tools, have a homelab, and all that but I also have a family and a personal life where I'm not worried about being 1 deep on topics at work since I know my boss has my back.

Be fair, it's not like he said you have to dedicate 100% of your off hours to working. If you're in a situation where you're working 65 hours a week, your situation sucks and it makes sense you don't want to do more.

But the ones closer to the beginnings of their careers, the ones most often wondering about advancement and career progression, aren't necessarily going to have that limitation.

>  Why do we keep internalizing the failings of management? It's killing us trying to meet and exceed the unrealistic expectations that most companies project on technical folks.

The way I read it (through OP's proselytizing) is that progress isn't necessarily on management.

What's funny is that in every other field that isn't IT, the career progression scramble dictates that you get up the ladder into management as soon as possible. That way, you don't have to do whatever mind-numbingly boring paper processing task your department does anymore, you supervise those that do, and there's no more technical learning needed. It's hard to explain to people that you can still have a reasonably good career progression by continuing to actually do work, as long as you invest the outside learning time. I've heard from the wife and others, ""Why aren't you a manager yet?"", not in a mean way, but more like in a concerned way.

Everyone takes away something different from the conference circuit.  For me I gain very little from the keynotes, but I gain a ton from the side conversations during the conferences.  You network with peers and you start to talk shop.  You find someone who is doing similar things that you are doing, and now you have a peer to bounce ideas off of.  This is really valuable at times.  You also get to learn how other Orgs handle their tech and processes.  This is also very good info at times.   You may not go to a keynote and say wow that changes my entire outlook, but you may have dozens of conversations with your peers that do change your outlook, or give you great ideas.   

I mean I have gone to conferences and then web conferenced a month or two later with the team I networked with to go over things we are both working on.  Sometimes there can be value in that.

I made enough to get by comfortably, but I never had (or have, I guess) nice cars, we didn't do big family trips, I didn't buy expensive bourbon to share with friends, and I didn't have a lot of discretionary income for games and such.  But we ate healthy, did things like camping on friends property, and my wife was able to not work and stay home with kids (which is a big contributor to not being ""well off"").

With that said, I worked with absolutely wonderful people, had an excellent mentor, and have an extremely healthy work/life balance (verging more on the life than work, tbh).  I learned a lot and had freedom to grow.

When my boss retired I became director (which is more like the leader of technology in the district, rather than a ""true"" director for a fortune 500).  So I make more money now and we feel more comfortable taking vacations and such.

I guess my point is the same as yours:  My choice was to choose a lower salary for a higher life balance (and excellent working conditions).  I had offers to make more money other places, but never took them since I loved where I worked, what I did, and who I worked for.  It paid off in the long run since I'm able to run my own department now with a lot of trust from the School Board/CFO/CEO equivalent (superintendent/Financial Director)."

Many larger organizations have per-person training budgets, and most of those are flexible with how they are used. A good pattern is training diversity; you want different people exposed to different things, not all of them with the same things. So some of the staff can use training budget to attent conferences, some can choose online training courses, etc.

A smaller number of organizations have formalized internal learning programs or induction courses. Those are usually invaluable, but they're typically not used to introduce new methodologies or technologies until a decision has been made to adopt them.
