I've done some basic editing and cleaned up the Rust code quite a bit. Always use Rustfmt and Clippy on code you intend to publish.

    ### Language introduction
    
    Rust was born as a personal project by Graydon Hoare
    in 2006. It's a language that -- at the time of writing --
    is used to build the Firefox web browser, a few Operating
    Systems, high-performance servers and embedded systems
    code. Rust is considered a safer alternative to the language
    C because of the way it manages system memory.
    
    It's benefits are:
    
    1. Safety -- Unlikely to have memory-related bugs; prevents
       some types of threading bugs.
    1. Speed -- Rust programs have comparable performance to
       similar C and C++ programs.
    1. Concurrency -- Rust programs use native threads effectively.
    1. Cross platform -- Works on Linux, Windows, MacOS and many embedded devices.
    
    ### Code example
    
    #### ![Script icon](./images/script.png){ width=75px height=75px } name.rs
    
    ```rs
    struct Person<'a> {
        first_name: &'a str,
        middle_names: &'a [&'a str],
        last_name: &'a str,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let p = Person {
            first_name: ""Shaun"",
            middle_names: &[""Michael"", ""Kenneth""],
            last_name: ""Stone"",
        };
        println!(
            ""What?! You have two middle names, {} {} {}?"",
            p.first_name,
            p.middle_names.join("" ""),
            p.last_name
        );
    }
    ```
    
    Here is the output:
    
    ```txt
    OUTPUT:
    What?! You have two middle names, Shaun Michael Kenneth Stone?
    ```
    
    Yes… yes I do.
    
    ### Did you know?
    
    * The popular StackOverflow survey has voted Rust the
      most-loved language by developers from 2016 to date
      (2019).
    
    * Dropbox uses Rust for its core file storage system to
      serve over 500 million users.
    
    * Deliveroo uses Rust to make assignment decisions in its
      food delivery network.

The introductory quote is, I think, fairly stale. There's a lot more interesting things about Rust these days than its continued development.

The writing in general is awkward. There's a lot to be said about Rust that isn't here: in particular, there's no mention of downsides such as the tough learning curve and slowish compile times that folks complain about every day. The repeated reference to washing machines was weird and confusing — I removed it."

Rust in fact also supports FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Web Assembly, Solaris and derivatives, iOS, Android, Redox, Haiku, and [more](https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html). 

Perhaps: Rust is cross-platform, it supports many platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, and BSD."
