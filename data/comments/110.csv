1,TheD4rkSide,1633690984.0,2.0,"No is the simple answer. You're investing time and money into something so make sure you get something very good out of it.

Both pay considerably well. Yes, DevOps can pay more, but isn't necessarily always the case. Take it from your peers, and I'm sure most people will agree that any job within the larger IT domain can be stressful and annoying as fuck at times. You're better off dealing with them stresses whilst doing a job you love, rather than dealing with them stresses in a job you don't love.

I, for example love my job. I wake up every morning excited about going to work to sort out some network shit. Problem solving and the rewards that come with it are amplified tenfold because I love my job."
2,ahhh-what-the-hell,1633697077.0,2.0,"u/ouimahkami - I am pretty sure most people here will tell you: 

* DevOps is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your going to get.

DevOps is a workflow and lifestyle choice. Companies decided to warp it into a job title that  borders a system architect.

* DO position requirements are vast (AWS, GCP, JS, Python, C#, The BORG, Azure, Docker, BLAH, Jango Fett, etc) because they use a lot of different tech.

* Which brings me to System Design. I’m considered entry level as a developer. Although I decided to take some time to learn System Design before heading into the interviews. I may not be asked about it, but it’s another ace I have up my sleeve.

I’ve learned to code for to be a SWE. But I will apply to DO roles that look like SWE roles. If you can find a DO role that brings balance to the force, there is nothing wrong with that.

Three things that were interesting from the article.

* Senior executives and managers tend to have the most years of coding experience, while those working in data science and machine learning tend to have the least, on average less than even an academic researcher.

* No one likes Oracle or IBM cloud / Oracle or IBM databases

* Perl and COBOL are not well liked.

I thought DS and ML engineers had mad experience points.

No surprise Oracle and IBM are boring. Pretty sure TikTok is upset they have to use Oracles DB (Yikes).

I am learning COBOL. I though SWE learn an old language along with several new ones."
3,FourKindsOfRice,1633699413.0,1.0,"Looking at the survey I was like wtf these aren't good even in LCOL areas.

Then I swapped the USA. Much more accurate.

Really interesting data. Not surprising at all to me that DevOps, SRE, Backend are highest paid. They all require a more in-depth domain knowledge (of programming and other fields as well, such as infrastructure, networking, cloud, sysadmin, security, and more).

That said, Web Dev is probably easier to get into in the short term and will provide a perfectly good living, better than good even."

Devops is incredibly, vastly different than web development."
