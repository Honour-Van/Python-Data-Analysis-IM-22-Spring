Totally. Its your life do what you want.

The discussion whether or not someone should learn new languages mostly revolves around where the developer in question is at. For people just venturing into programming I generally give the advice of ""learn one thing and learn it well"", in hopes that they don't jump from language to language getting the illusion of learning (Since they have to re-learn language quirks and syntax).

For more seasoned developers it is perfectly fine, and recommended, trying out new languages and technologies. At this point one has a decent understanding on how to write software and have been able to write things outside tutorials.

Where you fall on this spectrum I don't know.

When it comes to Rust vs C/C++ I'd say don't think about it too much. Try to follow your interests and what you like (unless you're aiming for a job within a very specific niche, then you have to look at exactly what is being used)."

I've been programming for a few years and I feel comfortable to make my projects without tutorials. Next year I'll do my final master's thesis which probably will be in python, so I'm not looking for anything in short-term

I can use this time to start rust and try new things in my spare time, before and during my thesis (if I got enough time)

Again, many thanks. You've been a great help"
