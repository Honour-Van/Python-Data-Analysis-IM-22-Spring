I had the experience and education they were looking for.

When they asked me about a certain acronym and my experience with it, for whatever reason my brain just shut off. I said I had not really had much exposure to it and could not speak too much about it, in order to dodge the question since my mind had blanked.

Minutes after the interview I remembered exactly what it meant, and felt like a complete idiot for going on about my experience but not knowing that one thing.

Still got offered the job though, so I guess I wasn't too stupid lol"
