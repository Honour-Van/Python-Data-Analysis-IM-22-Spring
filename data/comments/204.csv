0,AequitarumCustos,1522843205.0,1520.0,"When I was younger, I couldn't be stopped from working overtime, for two reasons:

1. I loved what I did (started as a hobby, so work was fun).
2. I worked for a lot of start ups that had the pressure of ""get something profitable"". However it wasn't just downward pressure from owners, but also internal. I had equity, I identified my success with delivering and it fed my ego to an extent.

Over a decade and several burn outs later, I abhor overtime and love PTO.

Everytime I see someone working overtime, two thoughts go through my mind:

1. I really hope they don't get burned out.
2. Them working overtime to keep projects on schedule, prevents us from showing our need to have more resources allocated to our team. We sorely need more team members, but arguing for a budget increase for more resources when we're meeting goals is difficult.

TLDR:

Please don't work overtime unless you have (significant) equity. You hurt yourself, your team, and teach managers to expect it!"

4,yawaramin,1522844478.0,45.0,"This conclusion does not follow at all from the survey responses. Overtime means you’re working directly on projects for your employer. At best, the article surmises that devs _might_ be learning some tech in their off hours. There’s no indication that they’re learning anything related to their work projects. In fact, knowing myself I would guess that we’re all learning different tech that we find fun outside work.

There’s an article to be written about how biased the SO results are but it seems the author skipped all that and jumped straight to the conclusion that we need to warn off new devs about the dangers of their career path."
5,fuckin_ziggurats,1522841847.0,507.0,"> I’m pretty confident that a few people will vehemently disagree with this post, and will let me know in the comments.

Well here I am. The StackOverflow survey was heavily biased towards.. guess who. Developers who use StackOverflow often enough that they notice a survey is being conducted and have enough time to take part in it.

If I tried to act like I know who these developers are then you may say I'd be making broad-brush strokes just like StackOverflow did with their survey results interpretation. But you'd be incorrect because the survey itself tells us about the type of developers that responded to it. They are:

- Young
- Males
- Inexperienced
- With no children
- Who do a lot of home programming
- Who use StackOverflow enough to notice the survey

If you think this is a realistic painting of most developers then you've never worked professionally. Posts that take those survey results at face value and then use them to misinform young upcoming developers about how it is to work in this industry should not be tolerated."

It seems to be confusing the idea of coding for fun and working on open source projects with overtime.

To me, it seems similar to claiming NBA players work too much overtime because they like to go play basketball for fun in their spare time.

Programming can be a lot of fun.  Developers who really enjoy it and get into it tend to do a better job and have an easier time getting hired... But that doesn't mean there's a crazy overtime requirement in the majority of developer jobs out there."

50,zbubblez,1522875916.0,1.0,"Coming from the college perspective. The further I get into my degree I have become more and more frustrated with they way in which programming is taught. It seems as if teachers strive to have the students grind as much as possible as if that's the best way for them to learn. The classes that have been most ""difficult"" in my career so far are the ones where the professors write instructions as if we already knew the struture and background information pertaining to the project they were assigning. The directions are cryptic and tiptoe around the main goal leaving students confused and completely overwhelmed. We spend more time googling and coming up with weird ways to try and satisfy these weirdly written requirements. I understand that this in itself is useful, troubleshooting is a good skill and being familiar with Google and other resources is a good skill to have in this career. But the biggest downfall is that most students don't ever even get to actually practice coding as much as I believe would be necessary to be comfortable with any language. We spend all our timing grinding out these tedious and time consuming base level calculations when we could be using this time to gain a really good grasp on a language by writing diverse and entertaining programs. Instead we're stuck rewriting old code so we can ""understand"" how it works even though the library for this code was written 20 years ago by people that founded the language and have the functions completely optimized. My point is that it seems like people focus way to much on how much time people are putting into these jobs rather than the usefulness of what the person is doing. "

Reasons not to work overtime:

1.  It's contagious, toxic insecurity.  Many less-experienced developers are quietly afraid that if they can't meet their goals during working hours, they need to put in the extra time to take up their own slack and prove they're worth their pay.  What it does instead is to create a culture where other workers start to feel insecure for going home at a reasonable hour.
1.  It hides process problems.  Overcommitment is a shared problem.  On one hand, even experienced engineers are *terrible* at estimation.  You'll never get better at it if you don't get it wrong and learn from it.  On the other hand, your management doesn't see the overtime.  They just see what the team accomplished in a given time, and that's their only data source to estimate what the team can accomplish in the future.  Thus the reward for good work is more work.
1.  Crunches happen.  Opportunities arise with dates attached, and you need all hands on deck to pull them off.  If you're working overtime habitually just to accomplish your standard daily tasks, you've got nothing left to give when this happens.
1.  As a front-line engineer, you will *never* be recognized or compensated in proportion to the amount you hurt yourself, and over time that builds a low-level resentment.  I've occasionally seen people ragequit over relatively minor things once they hit this point.
1.  Your willingness to voluntarily work overtime eventually translates into a belief on the part of many employers that they have a 24/7 claim on your time.  When forced overtime doesn't cost any more than a 40-hour week, it can be hard to resist the temptation to throw the engineering staff under the bus as a solution to problems for which they'd come up with a smarter solution if they had to pay for the labor.  There's a huge psychological difference for the employee between what he *offers* to do and what he's *expected* to do, but the difference seems much smaller to the employer, to the extent he may make the mistake of assuming it's all the same.
1. An organization that takes its employees for granted, and does not respect them or their time, will suffer a certain amount of attrition.  Lots of employers fool themselves that they're selecting for loyalty, but the unfortunate reality is, it's your most talented people who can most easily find a better opportunity.

To the voluntary overtime slave: You don't have a social life?  Go get one.  You don't have a family?  You never will at this rate.  You just love coding so much?  I bet you have your own projects.  If you don't, go come up with some.  The diversity of experience will make you a better engineer overall, and the real payoff is that your management is forced to plan for the actual, realistic capacity of the team.  You have to help in planning for a sustainable pace by insisting on demonstrating by your work habits what a ""sustainable pace"" looks like."

Most people in the software industry can't get (1) and don't want (2), even though it's not such a bad deal once you're older and know what work is for most people. 

Venture-funded software runs on the work of the semi-privileged: middle-class white males who fall prey to quixotry.

Truly privileged kids know how to become venture capitalists or, better yet, go to the buy side. They know that working 90 hours per week on someone else's project is an idiot's game. 

Unprivileged kids had to learn some hard truths about human nature in order to survive, and the ones who come up into our sphere are the top few percent. So they're generally too street smart to end up throwing down 90 hours per week for some founder's career.

Women tend to date a few years ahead, so they know which careers are legit. They also (on average) have to be decent judges of character (compared to men) because they get so much attention when they're young from creeps, so most of them, when they talk to startup founders, remember that 27-year-old guy (they're basically the same guy) who ""generously"" offered concert tickets to high school girls, and nope right out. 

This leaves semi-privileged men as the only ones stupid enough to get into tech startups.

You will most likely need another 4ish years of schooling to turn you into one. Or you will land a job at a company and have your peers and leads spend the next 4-8 years teaching you to become a software engineer. 

Part of the problem is that you ( and so many of your peers  ) entered into the degree with no idea of what it pertains to or what it will qualify you to do .

Basically, it should be one of two things. Would provide a -realistic- possibility of exiting with 6/7 figures (which is going to be rare), or will provide passive income enough to pay at least a couple bills per month.

Generally, the startups I worked with were LLCs and we had profit sharing agreements; usually in the range of around 10%. This percentage was due to the fact they were still paying me, but at below market rate.

If you're getting shares in a corp, make sure you understand the vesting agreement and what you need to do to actually get your shares (I missed out on some due to not sending a $1 check by a certain date).

As far as profit sharing agreements go, also be careful of ""hollywood accounting""; where owners are making money but the company is showing a net loss, so no profit and no pay.

Didn't run into any hollywood accounting, just a lot of failures. The guy I worked with on several, he finally had a successful one I wasn't a part of. The developer for that has made enough money every month from profit sharing to pay his bills from that project alone.

---

TLDR: Significant equity = Passive income will pay some of your monthly bills, or if project is successful, could pay off a nice car/small house. Both are a risk of not happening, keep that in mind; and the equity usually comes with a reduced salary (full salary comes once company is profitable).

The question is flawed because it makes big assumptions about what coding is and what the implications of coding at home means. 

I like building nerd shit on arduinos and rpis. Things like making an automatic watering system for my wife's flower garden (She'll love it, one day, I swear), my automatic window opener and closer for my man cave, and some shitty autonomous drone that flew straight towards a tree and was destroyed by magpies. 

Is that ""coding as a hobby""? Maybe, I do code in it. I also spend a lot of time in CAD so I can 3d print or make plans to be laser cut, so do I also do CAD as a hobby? I also do a lot of wiring and learning how to wire properly, am I doing electronics as a hobby? I also swear a lot, am I swearing as a hobby? 

My uncle was a boilermaker by trade. He used to build trains when Australia still did that kind of stuff. Because he didn't like talking to his wife he also built things at home. He built a caravan, a boat, some very comfy deck chairs that I inherited (thanks Mick!), and he used to make custom built draw ... liners? ... for his mates tool draws. Did he ""bang things with hammers as a hobby""? Well, yes, I suppose he did, but it wasn't the same as doing his job each day. 

My Uncle, liked to solve problems. His tools were hammers, drills, hacksaws, and planes. Those were his tools because he was a tradesman. I also like to solve problems. Because I am a programmer, my tools are electronics, CAD, and programming.

And none of it will ever be paid in a way or another. (And I mean not only these hours are not paid more per hour, but they are not paid at all, they do not officially exist.) And it is of course even worse in pathological sectors like the game industry.

The 35 hours week is applied effectively in a fair share of 'lower' ranked jobs, but not in high qualification jobs, unless you work in a very large company (with a history of having strong unions). But less and less people are employed in large companies in this business. "

They never heard about this weirdness; first of all, if I work over hours that would be because I am not capable of doing it in the allotted time (wrong estimations being my own fault and all) and secondly, if there would be compensation because I was asked to remain after hours, it would be for my normal rate. 

Then I told a little story about me working as a logistics employee for a summer when I was young (I packed boxes with crap for supermarkets) at a logistics warehouse for a big supermarket chain; if I worked normal hours, I got $y but if I worked at night I got 2.5x $y; as programming is a vastly more stressful (that one summer I chose working nights at that logistics center because I wanted something I could switch my brain off) and more educated enterprise, I suggested we start at 5x. 

I didn't get (or would've taken) the job as the recruiter was already a joke with all he said up to that point. 

In reality I do not thing overtime should be charged 5x, but people need to know how you value your time early on in my opinion. If they find this a joke, you know you don't want to work there. You can still decide(!) to work overtime for nothing or cheaper, but at least they should know what a big favor you are doing them.

I don't think about programming when I go home, again unless I'm trying to solve a problem that requires it. I don't really even give two flying fucks about coding in my day job. I just like solving problems and swearing. Also drinking. 

I am pretty good at programming. I studied how to do it at university. I did it for a living for a long time. Now I teach kids how to do it. I left programming because I mostly built similar solutions to problems I've encountered before. 

Sure, there were projects I did at home that required some kind of programming and some times I wondered how things work in other parts of my industry (like game development) but this wasn't because I was interested in ""coding"". It was because I was interested in solving some problem. Like, how do dodgy side scrollers handle double jumping? I don't know how to solve that problem without learning how to code it, so I did. Just like how I had to learn how to use CAD so I could effectively make designs for the laser cutter. 

The only time I care about ""coding"" is when I teach young nerds how to program. Once we pass those early days of how code we quickly go into identifying problems and learning how to break them up into manageable chunks so we can solve them. 

The automated garden watering project is probably less than 500 lines of code. I think I wrote the majority of it during a staff meeting. I spent way more time learning how to water proof my circuits. Hell, I spent more time building the garden bed than I did coding. 

""Coding"" is just a tool that I can use to do my hobby. That tool is not my hobby. Sure, I used it to automate a garden watering system but I also hit nails with hammers to make the garden, but I do not hit nails with hammers for a hobby, nor do I solder copper wire together for a hobby even though I did a lot of that too.

Regular work weeks are 35 hours and overtime pay isn't mandated until more than 44 hours. So as long as you don't work more than 9 extra hours a week the employer doesn't have to pay you any extra.

/u/ApatheticBeardo is saying that you shouldn't feel pressured into doing extra work just because you're less experienced than someone else.

Lets put it this way, I'm a programmer. If I was going to hire a programmer I would pay them at a rate that I think is proportional to their experience. Lets say:

10 years of experience = 100k

8 years of experience = 80k

If I hire the programmer with 8 years of experience I don't expect that they're going to get the same amount of work done in the same number of business days as the programmer with 10 years of experience. I don't expect the programmer with 8 years of experience to work overtime to match the work of the programmer with 10 years of experience.

I cant imagine a developer not doing quite a bit of SQL with their regular development.  And complex SQL is at least as difficult as complex calculus.  I am not sure what Codd's model would have to do with that.  

There is a bunch of data in a database that you have to combine in some often very complex way to produce a different set of data.  Pretty common and often what I would consider difficult math.

> Do you have examples of the difficult math and what it was for?

Even for just a reporting app where you have to combine a huge amount of tables in a meaningful way.  Then grabbing the data, a lot of that date manipulation stuff can get difficult.  Then you have to check multiple data from multiple tables, combine using some kind of business logic and produce reports.  

So I would say most reporting apps can get into difficult calculus level math pretty easy.  Even if you are only doing statistics finding probabilities, standard deviation (scanning for when something didnt work right), and percentiles that stuff is college level math as well."

Your attitude of “i like what the company is doing” is misguided. If it is a startup, that kind of exchange of value should be met with equity, not demanding it is where the subversion comes in, so people have every right to be annoyed at you. they are allowed to have passions to, and may well offer more value to a company, but you are undercutting at the low low price of free.

And to the next point, if this is a big company that is on its feet, well then you might just have delusions of grandeur. No amount of good will is going to get you up the ladder, they probably don’t give a shit how many extra hours you put in. It’s not a value creating proposition at that point, it’s a cost saving one, for them. People who have a lot of passion and want to get ahead don’t give all their time to someone else. Unfortunately, most established companies are not a meritocracy. It takes a lot less effort to cheat your way up the ladder (or already start most of the way up it) so most people at the top tend to have done some of that.

Nearly any employee will, for the most part, support another when they find out the manager threatened to fire them for not being able to give a decent time estimate and they were given no details.

He talks about sprints as being short term emergency-like work. He suggests they show you can't work on a long-term project. That's bogus. The value is breaking down big items into small iterations so you can keep delivering value incrementally. If the business shifts underneath your $10 million project, you are better positioned to A) know what does/doesn't work anymore and B) cut your losses. The biggest benefit is constant feedback instead of dropping your chip from the top of the Plinko board and waiting 6-9 months to see if it lands in 10,000 or 0. 

He never really justifies why a 7+ would leave under those circumstances. He seems to be projecting this notion that all 7+ devs want to spend months on ponderous science projects before unveiling their masterpiece upon the unwitting public. That's egotistical horseshit. If you have a long-term value driver, you can almost universally find ways to break it down and deliver it iteratively. The ability to work on what is providing the most value to the business you support is what makes you a high-value developer. Not your knowledge of complex algorithms or programming patterns. No dev above a 5 on this arbitrary scale we are referencing should, with a straight face, propose they go off for months on end to rewrite some chunk of an application without input. The idea that my ""creative juices"" can't get flowing if my work gets in front of a stakeholder/sme for feedback frequently is utterly preposterous. 

>From the point of view of a manager unaware of how software works

Bingo. His problem is bad management, not Agile. Bad managers do agile badly just like they do everything badly. They're bad.   
Not every sprint is required to have tickets that are myopic. I regularly work on projects for long term value streams, but we deliver bits to production every 2 weeks. It might not even be functional yet, in which case the entire feature is toggled off with a feature flag or permissions. There's nothing about that which would drive a great software engineer away. I don't want to work with someone who can't handle that. It tells me they have an ego and want to blunt requests to change based on feedback with ""it was X months of work and already done, live with it"".

Now, I will agree on a few details. I'm not a SCRUM advocate. It's the epitome of shrink-wrapped cargo-cult Agile™ that you will find out there today. It's hyper-focused on artifacts and checking boxes. There are nuggets of good ideas in SCRUM that reflect well on agile principles as a whole, but it's far to rigid and prescriptive. To me, the single most important part of Agile is the flexibility to change what it means to your organization. Are 2 week sprints not working out for you? Do 3 weeks. Or 1. Or a month. Or do continuous deployment where your cycle time is 4-5 days, but you might release multiple times a day. Do your stand-ups work better before lunch? Fine. Do you like having retro every week instead of after every iteration? Sure!   

Agile is like Dungeons and Dragons. The only thing worse than no DnD is bad DnD. I think this person seems soured by bad agile wherever they worked. "

If it's a real danger to users, wouldn't he/she see the importance of it? In that situation I would expect a manager to *insist* that the project is extended, rather than a single developer work late to fix it, because of the chaotic nature of software and how fixing one bug can cause another to appear.

Maybe I'm just a Web 2.0 taxi website ninja, but I have a hard time seeing a situation where writing a couple dozen more lines of code in a given day will save a life or keep the business afloat for another year.

751,vermiculus,1522863975.0,2.0,"One thing to keep in mind is that for safety-critical systems, there is usually a strict code review and QA process for any and every change. Nothing goes out untested, though mistakes do happen. We're only human and we can't know every possible state of the system at any given time. When mistakes do happen, depending on the impact (which also has a formal safety review process itself), it's everyone's responsibility to make the system safe to use.

In my experience it's less about writing code and more about figuring out what's causing the issue. Often times it's reported as happening in a remote system and we have a very hard time reproducing it in-house. Often, many people will try to reproduce in separate instances of the software. Once it can be reliably reproduced in-house, the fix usually comes out within a few hours or a room is reserved for many people to share the work to resolve the issue as completely and as quickly as possible (prioritized in that order). Because many people are involved in development, no one person carries the load or is held uniquely responsible; we don't have a concept of blame/shame so there's no external pressure to resolve the issue – regardless of the internal pressure we inflict on ourselves as the developers introducing that bug, but I think that's a sense of ownership that most of us experience.

Sometimes we never find a source for the issue and will instead either a) reason about the issue until we find a hole that *could* cause it or b) bite the bullet and push a patch rather than a true fix (if I'm making that distinction clear). In these cases, getting it do no harm is more important than doing it right – which is also secondary to getting it to work.

After the fix is developed, the code review and QA process begins with much more intense scrutiny (i.e. devoted time) depending on the complexity of the area in the codebase. You should never be *hasty*, but get it out ASAP. Time is given and taken where it needs to be taken, but that does not imply working normal hours. While working long hours over a long period of time will burn you out faster than a forest fire in NYC, doing it for a few days won't kill you. It's usually expected to rest after since it can be such a stressful experience for the developer (with all that internal pressure which really is only human).
