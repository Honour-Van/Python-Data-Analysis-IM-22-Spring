3,thither,1628089453.0,25.0,"I tend to chalk the phenomenon to the fact that most Clojure developers already have a fair amount of Java / other JVM experience, to they tend to skew more senior than the general population, hence their compensation tend to be better as it's largely based on seniority.

I'd also caution against reading too much into the Stack Overflow ""insights"" data as indicating anything in particular about software development at large, as it's a purely voluntary survey with about the same level of statistical insight as one of those ""which Harry Potter character are you"" quizzes, albeit gussied up with a lot of pretty graphs."
4,I_Have_A_Snout,1628099569.0,8.0,"One of the factors that drives down salaries in any technology is outsourcing companies since they make money on the arbitrage between what they pay for people and what they sell people for, so their salaries tend to be on the low end. There aren't many large outsourcers who can provide bulk Clojure staff, so Clojure rates don't include that sector of the development community.  


Without a breakdown of location, industry and nature-of-employment, it does make the figures a bit misleading.  


That we're not looking at the same populations across languages also, probably, has a negative impact on Clojure adoption since it creates the - probably false - perception that you can't hire Clojure people without breaking the bank."

7,asiergaldos,1628088735.0,10.0,I have no clue but my guess is that it is age (more senior devs) and country (high GDP) related.
8,edster3194,1628095348.0,3.0,"The main points are already covered by others in this thread. One additional point would be that it is very common for Clojure developer positions to also require proficiency in some other languages.

Clojure makes interop between other JVM languages (and Javascript) so dang easy it is hard to for teams not to take on a little Java/Scala/etc in their code bases... but now your job posting needs to hire someone with 2 languages rather than 1, which pushes the salary up a bit.

I think this is minor compared to the other reasons discussed in this thread, but you don't have to look at many job posting before you see a pattern."

35,seancorfield,1628097211.0,7.0,"I think it is only ""notoriously difficult"" if your background is purely OOP and you've only ever written code that relies on mutation and side effects (a lot of Java developers are in this category).

If you are new to programming or have been exposed to ""functional style"" in other languages (especially if you've been exposed to immutable data in some form), it's not difficult to pick up.

The ""encapsulate everything"" and ""mutate everything"" mindsets are hard to shake off when you switch to immutable data-oriented programming -- and that's what makes the switch to Clojure hard for some.

As for the higher salaries, I think it's a combination of some seniority, some supply and demand, and some aspect of being able to get more done with fewer people so you might have two Clojure developers instead of four Language X developers and you can ""afford"" to pay them more because you're paying for half as many programmers (who are twice as productive).

39,ilemming,1628095194.0,34.0,"Clojure is also quite often used in digital banking/fintech:
 
- Nubank (the largest digital bank in South America)
- Funding Circle (peer-to-peer landing)
- Capital One (had a Clojure team. Not sure if they still do)
- Happy Money
- Intuit
- Dividend Finance (solar loans)
- Salesforce
- Silicon Valley Bank
- Verrency
- Zen Finance

A few companies that I could name off the top of my head.

Money necessitates reliability and requires defect-free software. At the same time, modern, digitized money management desires flexibility and efficiency in fixing bugs and adding new features; Clojure very often fits perfectly for it.

I also second the notion that the majority of Clojure developers are experienced, seasoned programmers, for whom Clojure is a deliberate choice after working in many other alternatives (in some cases for many years).

Clojurists don't concern themselves with the popularity of certain tools or techniques; They don't care for things like MSFT marketing shoveled in your mouth. Die-hard pragmatists, they'd use an instrument if it makes sense. They don't give two shits about OOP propaganda or extreme functional purity, or the notion such as ""not using static types is immoral"" and shit like that, they'd use object-orientation where it makes sense; metaprogramming, where desired; constrains, if applicable, etc. 

ROI from hiring a small team of Clojurists (even if they have to write in something else) would be much higher than paying the same money for a larger team of more ""traditional"" stack developers."

 I think it is often quite difficult for experienced programmers to learn because there is a ton of things that they do everyday in their OO that are just missing from Clojure because of its immutability..  It changes the way problems are solved, and if you have been solving problems the same way for 10 or 15 years, and suddenly you cannot do it that way, it is quite jarring for some..

If you learn that way in the first place, you don't have a lot of unlearning to do, and it is much easier.   Also if you hate the problems in OO that Clojure is solving, it is a lot easier to be thankful for a alternative..  If you are just learning it for something else to learn and you haven't bought the philosophy yet, it is VERY hard.."

58,fingertoe11,1628093503.0,4.0,"Another factor that makes Clojure hard is ""The Curse of Lisp""  basically because it is rather easy to roll your own \_\_\_\_\_\_  library, there are 5 or 6 options, and no consensus on which one is used by the community.

So in many languages there are rather set ways of doing things that can be put together in frameworks, Clojure tend to be a library by library assembly each time..    These are typically trivial choices which don't matter since all choices accomplish the same goal and do it well, but it can be overwhelming for newcomers..I believe that end the end those who persevere tend to come out ahead.  Because typically frameworks you see in other languages get you 80% there, but when you go to do the final 20 percent you have to learn 50 percent of the architecture behind the framework to make any progress anyway..   So Clojure front-loads that burden.  You pick the 80% library by library then when you get to the last 20% you know that the system works the way you told it to work.."
