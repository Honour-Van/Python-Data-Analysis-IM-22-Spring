1,Diapolo10,1521032494.0,5.0,TFW I'm in the last category. 
2,ComputerFido,1521093760.0,1.0,I have never had a job :/
3,ImpulseTheFox,1521028499.0,37.0,"If you don't have any reason to, it's not bad, but it's not good either. In fact I think v it's only displayed as bad in this meme to make the punchline in the last panel work."
4,,1521053748.0,17.0,"If you're happy and your financial needs are met, then you're in the right place. A good way to lose happiness is to greedily seek more happiness. If you've found green grass, then other grass is rarely greener."
5,DoctorBigtime,1521036520.0,9.0,"If you’re happy with your company and pay it’s fine, but with the industry the way it is you can get an easy raise by jumping every ~2 years. It adds up"

7,CrazedToCraze,1521061320.0,3.0,"This is my experience, but the key phrase is ""if your financial needs are met"". You'll make a lot more money hopping jobs than staying in one for the long haul. "
8,theonlydidymus,1521080244.0,1.0,"Truth! People often fail to realize that seeking to be happy hardly ever does what it’s supposed to. 

Rather than seeking to be happy, we should seek to live our personal values. When you do things that align with your values you feel *fulfilled* and *meaningful* which is like happy, but not quite, because bad stuff still happens but that’s okay. 

There’s a book about it, “the happiness trap.”"
9,,1521062658.0,6.0,"But I carefully phrased my comment the way I did, because the question I feel people should be asking themselves is ""do I even need to make more money""?

At some point, enough is enough. Like, for me, I could probably go out to the market and make another $10K. But I'm already make enough money to do all the things I want to do. 

If you're happy at your job and you make enough money to be happy, then it seems silly to me to go and rock the boat. "
10,belkarbitterleaf,1521062018.0,2.0,"Probably true, but in my recent experience I was able to get a significant raise at a company I've been with for 5 years. I had a talk with my CIO about how I was happy where I was, and wanted to make a career staying at my company, but knew I could go elsewhere to get paid more. "
