1,healydorf,1529075633.0,1.0,"The deciding factor in my last job hunt (~1 years ago) was the type of projects I'd be working on.

My current team is very research driven. The org has this big pot of data we can be doing cool things with. The current product we're about to ship to our customers is a platform that predicts when primary/secondary school students are at-risk of dropping out by doing some clever statistical modeling on risk factors. I don't do it for the little potential drop-out Jimmies and Susies of the world though; I like this team because we work on complex problems and I get to learn cool new domain-specific stuff that I absolutely would not have otherwise pursued. Psychology, economics, sociology, any discipline that involves the development/progression of a human population generally is on the table. We're a small-ish org, but our work has attracted the interest of some top academics. People who get flown around the world to give talks and sit on panels. 

Our internship cycle and ongoing research agreements put me in close contact to some really smart people that are tackling cutting-edge shit.

I like learning. I like teaching our researchers cool shit and giving them tooling to enhance their work. I like smart folks coming together to solve really complicated problems."
