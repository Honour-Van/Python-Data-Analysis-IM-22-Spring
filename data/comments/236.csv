1,PeoplesFront-OfJudea,1649940551.0,17.0,90% of people on those forums are just full of themselves and want confirmation that they’re smarter than others because their moms didn’t give them that attention lol
2,OriginalUsernameX,1649901232.0,66.0,Isn’t part of the point of stackoverflow to help gain a sense of understanding in the field?
3,rnike879,1649934956.0,25.0,"The reason you get asked to pose better questions, is to avoid SO becoming like yahoo answers or quora, where questions are vague and answers often make little to no sense, sourced straight from an unwiped ass"
4,generousNotJealous,1649911796.0,14.0,What mod did you guys fight with for the first time? I exchanged nasty messages with that Portuguese guy with an afro. Fucking loser.
5,bleistift2,1649955625.0,3.0,"\> “You’re demonstrating a lack of understanding in the field” 

Is there a source for this? Or just some random *bohoo StackOverflow baaaaad* repost?"
6,AnatolyX,1650011162.0,3.0,"Precisely the experience I made with stackoverflow. The site is only good for reading existent answers, not asking questions, and if the question you asked wasn’t answered I suggest you give up on the project you are currently working on."
7,djingo_dango,1649936627.0,8.0,The worse thing than stackoverflow is the low effort and inaccurate memes about stackoverflow
8,RRumpleTeazzer,1649913924.0,-20.0,"You cannot praise stackoverflow for its usefulness while simultaneously complain about its policies.

Those are two sides of the same coin."
9,superitem,1649994794.0,1.0,"To be fair, CPR is not relevant to stackoverflow."
10,Striking_Equal,1651200764.0,1.0,"I do find stack overflow very pretentious at times. You ask a simply Python question or whatever, and either a Karen type moderator removes it suggesting a question almost completely unrelated to your post. Or, you have a bunch of tools who are upset that you spelt some random word incorrectly, and won’t answer your question as a result. If you know, just answer the damn question!"
11,epeets,1649901560.0,65.0,Yup and many people who answer questions on StackOverFlow don't understand what the site is for. - _-
12,djingo_dango,1649936533.0,6.0,"No. I wish there was a stack site dedicated to discussion/forum type questions. But as of right now, stackoverflow is meant to be a wiki. So questions that are tailored to one specific user's issue is difficult to handle"
13,Jorengarenar,1649922443.0,10.0,"No, not really. It's for solving precise and unique problems, so programmers in the future with the same problem will have a reference.

SO is horrible for discussions (as it never was designed with them in mind) due to its Q&A nature. It's one question, multiple answers and eventual comments to the answers. Compare it with Reddit or Hacker News where we have whole comment trees. Or with traditional forums  with multi-leveled quotes on daily basis."
14,bdaileyumich,1649908021.0,-11.0,Apparently it is also to help you learn CPR
15,yerofadideto,1649933372.0,3.0,They bot complained that my  post didnt' have enough text or it wasn't spelled correctly so I just clicked X.
16,rabb2t,1649937994.0,5.0,"There are some real issues users are regularly encountering. Of course this meme is exaggerating them, but you should know better than taking a meme to the letter."
17,Josselin17,1649930322.0,11.0,yet you live in society ! I am very smart !
18,zachtheperson,1649969613.0,2.0,For about the past year Reddit's been my go to for tech questions. I find so many of my questions these days require at least some kind of back and forth in order to be solved and SO just doesn't do that well.
19,LazyBird_,1649923535.0,16.0,It's called an analogy. The purpose is to represent the situation in a different context that highlights the absurdity of the behavior and make it easier for anyone to relate.
20,djingo_dango,1649938100.0,1.0,There's a good solution. Use subreddits and ask the exact same question and compare the results. See which is better for yourselves rather than looking at the memes
21,Jorengarenar,1649977753.0,2.0,"Good, very good. There is less and less of unasked problems left which are suitable for SO. But people seem to not want to understand that (despite [it](https://stackoverflow.com/tour) being literally shoved right into their faces after registering), hence stricter and stricter rules, which sometimes (more often than desired) can target not so bad questions too.

But believe me, when I say there is tremendous amount of:

* beginner questions - either answered multiple times already or requiring tutorial and guidance (which SO explicitly is not for)
* easily googleable questions - literally copy-paste of the title into search engine and they get their answers
* homework ""questions"" - no comment required
* unreadable gibberish - elementary schooler ought to have better English (not native speaker, of course)
* readable, but without any regards for style, grammar or punctuation
* off-topic - just because it's tech problem, doesn't mean it's programming and just because you are solving task programmatically doesn't mean it's programming problem
* never updating question with info requested in comments
  * minimal, reproducible example is a dream, not standard part of the questions"
22,lolnubomgwtfhax,1649952792.0,3.0,"Sir, this is r/ProgrammerHumor... that was obviously a joke. Everyone knows what an analogy is."
