But yeah, Angular has more questions asked about it (101,124 vs 76,975). I don't think the survey necessary confirms Angular is more *popular*. There could be plenty of reasons it's skewed one frameworks over another. E.g. more devs who visit StackOverflow are using Angular. Given the survey was mostly advertised on stackoverflow etc this ties in with the survey results. Maybe React devs ask questions elsewhere! Or maybe React is so great they don't get stuck and need to ask questions. Or more React devs learn through courses/bootcamps thus less likely to hit SO.

76,kare_kano,1520968915.0,2.0,"> PHP is still the most important language for backends

Wide-spread, yes. Important... depends how you define that. Sheer number of existing (legacy) systems written in PHP is a major factor, definitely.

But the adoption rate is dropping very rapidly. Among beginners, JavaScript+Mongo+React is the new hot thing they learn by themselves, and it comes with the advantage of being full stack and exposing you to lots of interesting technologies.

Most of the decision makers picking PHP for new projects today are people who are forced to. They either have to work with developers who are most/only experienced in PHP, or have legacy systems restricting their choice. It's usually a decision that a certain market or geographical area makes for them, not a choice. Given complete freedom they will pick something else, because PHP's characteristics (monolithic runtime, template-oriented output, awkward design choices, lots of language quirks, MVC pattern) make it a good fit for only a very small range of projects. 

PHP itself is a great platform, in spite of its shortcomings. I would love to see a redesigned version (or a fork) that fixes all the quirks and has a modular runtime. It needs to break with backwards compatibility. I guarantee you that such a version would re-take the web by storm and shoot back to the top of all the possible tops.

If such a version doesn't appear, the same thing will happen to PHP that happened to jQuery or MySQL. It will have a long and gradual fall out of grace. It will not die out, but it will be relegated to an increasingly smaller niche."

I design massively distributed web apps and run the teams that implement them. We stopped picking it for new projects years ago. Occasionally we have to integrate with existing PHP systems, because there's a great deal many of them out there, true. It's not a problem because many of us did PHP at some point in the past, and it's not hard to learn anyway. But we would not consider it for anything new. It's a chore to deploy and maintain, it's not flexible enough, it's hard to scale, it only has a limited number of interesting features (nothing you can't get somewhere else), it has serious faults and incomplete/immature interfaces, and to top it all off the language itself is full of traps and quirks."

""AngularJS"" is the old versions up to 1.6. This is still used in legacy stuff but no one in their right mind would use it over any of the current frameworks in a new project.

""Angular"", often ""Angular 2 (+)"" is a big rewrite from the ground up and a completely different framework. Note, that also confusingly the versioning changed to semver(ish), hence the +, so we're now on Angular 5. Angular 2, ~~3~~*, 4 and 5 are all very similar just like React 15, 16 etc.

Google is pushing hard that this is ""Angular NOT AngularJS"" but before Angular 2, everyone called Angular 1.6 Angular, not AngularJS - just like no one uses ReactJS.

Once you know about it it's not too bad to deal with though.

\* As pointed out below. There was no 3. Just to make things easier for everyone.

88,A-Grey-World,1520957691.0,15.0,"I see two general usages of ""full-stack"".

1. Some people use it for someone who has a *huge* knowledge of all parts of a stack. Like, to be full-stack you need to have 10-20 years experience. Deep knowledge is needed of every single area. You can architect everything from scratch to a very high standard fit for enterprise/scaling etc.

2. Others use it just for someone who works on all of the stack. You do some frontend stuff in React one day, then fix a DB table the other, then sort out that problem with the REST api. You're working on the all the stack. If you're a ""junior"" full-stack you probably won't be able to set up your own stack from scratch without some help and even then it might be okay for a small app but not an enterprise application.


I feel the second is more appropriate. Where on the stack you work has little to do with your total experience level. Why not use the reasonably established 'seniority' rankings (Junior, Mid, Senior) to denote expertise, and the 'stack' attribute (front-end, back-end, full-stack) to denote where that experience applies? Seems to make much more sense to me.

A newbie who's building his portfolio likely has some very junior full-stack experience if he's set up a server, webserver, DB, backend/API, and frontend etc. He might want to work on all those things in the future. It's so much easier calling that ""junior full-stack"" than ""junior with experience in... [list of everything in stack]"".

And most people use Notepad++ as a quick text editor. I didn't mean to imply it's bare bones software but a fairly big part of Sublime Text's user base uses it as a main development tool in contrast to Nodepad++ which most people use for quick edits. At least in my experience with fellow devs.

Well you're saying (I slightly edited it for emphasis there) that those are IDEs while Notepad++ is a text editor, and people treat it that way. Since my stance is that Notepad++ is in the very same category as the editors mentioned there, if indeed ""most people"" consider it separate like you do then that's the reason I was so annoyed for all those years. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code don't go in the same category, Visual Studio Code and Notepad++ do.

I agree in general but it's rapidly changing. VS Code is no longer what it was when it came out and its fast development means it will continue to evolve.

Correct. Maybe I should've mentioned Eclipse, PHPStorm, and IntelliJ instead of VS Code, Sublime Text, and Atom (although many front-end devs would have you believe those are somehow equally powerful).

It can be set up as an IDE (although I think it performs fairly poorly at that level, at least from a 'developer effort' perspective), but I suspect most of the people who use Sublime (and Atom, and potentially even VSCode) as an IDE would probably be equally likely to use it as a text editor - these semi-IDEs straddle the gap between IDE and text editor well enough that one usually doesn't need both.

OTOH, users of the 'full' IDEs (IntelliJ's offerings, Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc) probably do have a go-to text editor alternative to their main editor, because launching up IDEA just to have somewhere to paste a shell command you need is a pain in the arse.

> I really don't understand how so many people shame others for liking PHP,

That is neither here nor there. Why complain about shaming when someone offers arguments? Personally I like PHP, but I'm not going to pretend it's something it's not. It started out as a ""personal homepage"" language and it's still essentially a templating engine, because the people who make it don't want to change it. There's only so much you can do with a templating engine.

It needs to do what Python and Angular did, put out a redesigned version side by side with the original, which takes a fresh approach, fixes all the quirks and design mistakes, is endorsed by the original authors, and offers a migration path. That would give it the best of both worlds."
