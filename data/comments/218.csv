It's easier to think you are straight because society tells you when you're bi than when you're gay obviously but people continue to treat it as something that is rarer than homosexual.

""ambivalent gender identities"" are also far more common than ""incongruent gender identities"".

I really dislike terms like ""gay marriage"" or ""gay adoption"" for what should just be called ""same-sex marriage"" and ""same-sex adoption""; you don't even need to be ""gay or bi"" to do it; if you're straight as an arrow and want to live together with your best friend of the same sex and adopt children together then go for it; there's no rule in life you have to have sex with the person you raise a kid with."

I think Rust is so loved because if you've developed in C or C++, which is a non-trivial percentage of developers that build systems-y things (OS's, Browsers, Databases), you know that you write every line of code with fear. Multi threading isn't just a pain in these languages - it's a fool's errand. Source: worked on a highly multi-threaded cross platform application written in mostly C++ for three and a half years. It crashed - all the time.

If you don't have that experience, and have lived in JavaScript or Ruby or Python or Java, or anything garbage collected for the last 5 years, why would you care about Rust? If you're building primarily SaaS web apps why would you care about Rust? I think the answer is, you really shouldn't. Just keep doing what you're doing - those tools are much better for application development.

But applications today run on top of tons of infrastructure. No one writes Browsers in Java. No one writes an OS in Python. Those people care very much about Rust because what love have they gotten since 1980? They've been working without package managers, without garbage collection, and with tons of linters and static analyzers for decades just to avoid double-free and use-after-free errors. Rust's memory model solves a whole class of those problems, while also offering modern package management and popular language features like closures, optionals, and powerful ADTs. The standard library provides lots of high-level operations that you'd need to implement yourself in C or bring in a library.

Rust's demographic is dying for a language like it, and it wasn't Go. So if you don't love Rust, you're probably not supposed to, and that's totally fine. "

Using Rust would mean each project would take longer and cost more, while as a contractor, I need the opposite.  Rust is a better choice for things like high-performance or real-time apps and games, which is a small minority of development.

Those are some of the best salaries you can get in tech.

In finance/fintech, C++ is also one of the most important languages. Good C++ developers are incredibly hard to find. If you know C++ well and have a few years of experience, in NYC you'll have no problem picking up multiple offers north of 300K, potentially more. And demand is always high. Languages like python, Java, etc, you can always find someone, maybe a bit worse, maybe a bit better. A lot of the C++ devs I've interviewed are somewhere between bad and mediocre.

On top of all that, C++ is such a complex, multi-faceted language that many, many languages are quite easily to learn after C++.

COBOL, for example, is at 85% dreaded. That sounds reasonable, until you realize that it only consists of people using COBOL professionally. If you've looked into the world of mainframes you'll also find that COBOL is just one of the many tools used by the systems, instead of always a component one would be seeking to work with from the start. And, if you think about the people who would pursue COBOL, you'd realize pretty quickly that they are likely in it for either the opportunity of the legacy-work or the opportunity to work with mainframes. You can't say whether the people actually love or hate COBOL from any of that, but those are the factors that determined that low score of 15% saying that they explicitly wanted to continue pursuing work with it. 

You can't say that 15% of all developers love COBOL, and just as to say clouds mean rain you can't say that 85% of all developers dread it either.

I actually see a lot of Javascript, Python, and Ruby developers using Rust. If a Ruby application is slow because of Ruby, you can work around this by re-writing the hotspots in C.

However you are right that as a C++ developer I am glad that finally a new language is popping up which solves so many fundamental issues with C++.

I was very excited when Go was announced, and very disappointed when it was revealed: it wasn't what I needed to replace what I use C++ for (not high-performance/low-latency enough).

As for ""why not the take-up of Go"".  I genuinely don't know.  Quite often A vs. B comparisons between languages make no sense, as they all have strengths and weaknesses (even the unpopular ones, well most of them).  But the use cases for Rust and Go are nearly the same, and Rust is a superior language in nearly every way.

-	There are better NoSQL solutions, like Couchbase or Cassandra. MongoDB lies to your face. At its default settings, it will blithely tell you that a write has succeeded even though nothing has been persisted to disk or replicas. Yay! A database that loses data! Revolutionary.
-	Scalability doesn’t necessarily mean going NoSQL. A single PostgreSQL node can cover you for a good long while.

Sure, a valid point. A lot of this depends on your family/commute considerations. If you are single or don't mind a longer commute, then financially NYC still ends up making sense over many other areas. If you want to have a family of 3 and be 20 minutes from work, then yes, NYC is probably going to be harder even with double the salary.

> Glassdoor doesn't seem to agree that 300k is a common salary for c++ devs in NYC though.

Nowadays a lot of salary differentiation occurs by firm. 300K probably isn't typical across all C++ devs, but this is typical at the ""top tier"" of firms, for a relatively junior dev. Like in tech, the big 4 typically pay more than much of the next slice of major tech companies (like, SO itself does not seem to pay as well as Google by a substantial margin, from what I've seen). Maybe people who work there get more stock, more job satisfaction, or maybe they are just the people who aren't good enough to work at Google, I don't really know. In fintech it's similar, there are places who need/want very good C++ devs and are willing to shell out, and places that either don't have as high a standard, or simply aren't as profitable, and pay less.

>  What does c++ and a computational physics PhD get me?

At the ""top tier"" of companies, you should get at least 200 nowadays, I'd think. At Google/FB you'd need to pass fairly grueling CS style interviews. At top tier finance companies, you'll have less of that, but more actual C++ questions (if you are marketing your C++) and quant/math questions (if you are marketing your quant skills as a PhD in physics).

For a start, having option/result types and proper support for it in the language from day one ensures you will not have NullPointerExceptions. Pattern matching forces you to handle every case.
Generally Rust places much greater emphasis on being correct, and that shows in the language and stdlib design. This language forces you to be aware of every thing that could go wrong, and I was really surprised how many supposedly trivial things return Result and could fail in some rare circumstances. Traits allow you to avoid various pitfalls inherent to OOP. Macros provide a way to verify far more things at compile time.

> And how does it make things easier than those languages?

The tooling is superb. Dependency management is flawless. Algebraic data types and pattern matching come in standard, so does testing, benchmarks, build tools and many other things.
Traits allow anyone to add useful methods to types in a safe way.

A strong C++ developer with a few years of experience would be hired either at T4 or T5: https://www.levels.fyi/#; this site is based on anonymous surveys and it gives 230 and 360 respectively for those two levels. I don't really know too much about the details; when I talked to acquaintances at Google (when I was 2 years into the industry) though they said if I got an offer it would probably be ballpark 300K (I never applied). When I talked to a another acquaintance who worked at a fintech company and told me to apply, I said that I was looking for at least 300K, and he said that was no problem (again, he knew I then had 2 years of experience). Based on friends who have been hired, discussions with managers who make offers, basically every single data point suggests that you should crack the 300K mark somewhere between 2 and 5 years experience (in NYC) (many people end up way past 300K by 5 years).

If you look at any of the ""ask HN"" threads where people ask for numbers, tons of people will quote total comps of 300K and much more. If you look at H1B numbers, which are public but anonymized, and *only* include base salary, at e.g. Facebook, you see averages of 150K: https://h1bpay.com/companies/Facebook/cities/Menlo%20Park-CA/job-titles/Software%20Engineer/salaries. In FB/Google, at this level base is about half your comp, i.e. this means the average H1B applicant at FB (at Menlo Park) probably has total comp of around 300K.

I'm also extremely amused the way you mention ""popular language"", as if that somehow makes it easier to find people. Popular languages aren't just popular for people to know, they're popular to be used on real projects, so the demand tends to scale as well as supply. C++ is a hard language that remains difficult to move away from for many companies, for various reasons (performance, legacy), so there's basically been a perpetual dearth of *good* C++ developers for years.

That said, most developers aren't good. I've seen people on reddit claim there aren't jobs in NYC for C++, because they personally applied to 10 jobs and got no offers. Well, I've been on the interviewing side of that, and I probably recommend less than 10% of the people I interview for hiring. It's just because they're not actually very good (or at least, can't do anything in the interview to show they are good, like basic questions about how C++ works, or basic algorithmic questions)."

I don't want to open up that can of works again but that's an extreme simplification of sexism. There is a ton of institutional sexism in western countries too. Damore quoted (or well, cherry picked) one main paper on the topic as 'proof' that there was an inherent trait in women to not go into tech and even the author of that paper responsed saying he completely misinterpreted the findings.

The problem is that in the nature vs nurture debate it's almost impossible to create hard scientific proof without doing Nazi germany level experiments where you expose half of a twin to tech and another half you don't. But in most research there is a strong indication that a large component of the 'preference' of women against for example technical functions is nurture far more than nature. 

It is in fact completely possible that the preference of women against tech functions is 100% nurture. And this is not ""men keeping women down"" or anything; our entire education system supports this too: girls are not exposed to good role models at all. 

What I do **strongly** object to is people who claim that women are not into tech because they are women. Because this is actually strongly reinforcing the actual problem. 

What I find so difficult in this debate is that so many male developers don't even want to start considering that we're just getting it wrong. What if we are? What if women are just as good as men in tech? What if the reason they don't ""want"" to be in tech is because they've been told since they're born that tech is a boy's business? What if all the role models all of their lives reinforce that idea? If someone wants to at least entertain this notion and take is seriously then we can talk. But unfortunately most devs I know don't want to. 

For me personally teaching young girls as a volunteer for Devoxx4Kids really opened my eyes. If anything girls do better than boys at the assignments we gave them. And I think that whole concept is, to a lot of males, really scary. "

No, that makes me part of the *answer*.  I'm not the one ignoring reality. Scientists have done tests creating identical resumes and sending them to companies - half with WASP-sounding names like Warren Worthington III and half with ""ethic"" names like Dwayne and Laquisha. Those with WASP names got twice as many requests for interviews as the ethic names.

There's a widely publicized story of a man named Kim who couldn't get a job interview in the tech field. He changed his first name on his resume and suddenly interview requests came flooding in.

An experiment was done in the science field where scientists were asked to critique a paper. Again, the papers were identical, but half had a man's name and half listed a woman as the author. Scientists graded the paper with the woman's name on it lower. Worse, this apparently so subconscious and ingrained that even *women* scientists graded the female-authored paper lower!

Remember, Steven Colbert's joke that he ""doesn't see color"" was to point out that his character was really racist. You're echoing that conceit in sincerity. :-(

>It seems to be you who cares about the race of the people you work with.

Yup. And I've quit a racist employer before. I've also put together a Martin Luther King Day celebration when an employer decided to hold events for every holiday on the calendar but that one. I got MLK Day cards long after I'd left that job from black employees thanking me and telling me I ""didn't know how much it meant to them"" that I'd done that. But I guess you have to have minority co-workers in the first place to learn how much it means to them.

and a type of type `T` in C++ cannot be null either. `std::string` cannot be null  (and I'm pretty sure the proportion of `std::string*` in C++ code is similar to bad uses of unsafe in Rust code). `int` cannot be null, etc etc.

> less than a percent of Rust code touches unsafe blocks,

and only one bad use is enough to cause CVEs. It's entirely pointless to judge a language by ""societal"" metrics such as ""people usually don't do that here"". And it's hypocritical to say that a type system is sound and safe when there are backdoors in the language that allow to enter unsound places fairly easily. 
When you're in a company with people cranking 9am to 9pm for a few weeks, what the community does or thinks does not matter, if junior decided to put the whole function in an unsafe block at some point for speeding stuff up, no one's going to code review him and you'll get crashes three months later."

> But Go's ""memory footprint""—the amount of computer memory it demands while running Magic Pocket—was too high for the massive storage systems the company was trying to build. Dropbox needed a language that would take up less space in memory, because so much memory would be filled with all those files streaming onto the machine. So, in the middle of this two-and-half-year project, they switched to Rust on the Diskotech machines. And that's what Dropbox is now pushing into its data centers.

So, as I said, Dropbox uses Rust to power their storage layer (the Diskotech matchines). Or in short, they trust Rust with their user data.

Sine Dropbox is first and foremost a service to store data online, entrusting Rust with their user data qualifies, for me, as betting their core business on Rust.

Yes, the upper layers are in Go and Python, but as I keep saying *I am not talking about quantity here*^1 : the foundations of their business are in Rust.

^1 *Which I guess is why you were getting downvoted: using lines-of-codes or number-of-engineers as a metric is attempting to qualify quantity, which is NOT the point I am making. Or maybe people are just downvote happy. Meh :x*"

 adjective
1. of or relating to a system.

I was trying to talk about society from a sociopolitical standpoint and how there are structures built around gender and race (amongst others), but I might be translating directly from my mother tongue and in english the idea of systemic could convey something different. Nevertheless, I think you understood what I was trying to say.

There isn't much to disagree in ""society shouldn't seek legal instrumentation of positively discriminatory quotas"", but, at the same time, trying to enforce equity without tools is hard. It's a hard issue that gets too emotional too fast. Antagonizing and blaming strangers isn't going to do anything but fuel the toxicity, and that's what I wanted to say in my previous message. Not much, I know lol
