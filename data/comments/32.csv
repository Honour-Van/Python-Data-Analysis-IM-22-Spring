I can't believe Notepad++ is so widely used (nothing against it) by now I thought many people jumped ship to Sublime, plus part of my believed most of us just used either vim or emacs and now I know that was a silly perception.

> Upon closer examination of the data, a trend emerges: Developers increasingly prefer spaces as they gain experience. Stack Overflow reputation correlates with a preference for spaces, too: users who have 10,000 rep or more prefer spaces to tabs at a ratio of 3 to 1.

10,d4rch0n,1429071378.0,13.0,"A lot of us use vim of course, but it depends also on the code you write. You can definitely code Python/Ruby/Lua/C professionally with vim. You can set it up so it's an IDE, and for those guys you really don't benefit that much from code completion (but of course, that varies person to person). Personally, even on my workstation I don't have many plugins, just syntax highlighting. I can usually maneuver my code extremely easily, and making that easy to do also helps me write cleaner code. If the module is well named as well as the function, it's easy to find and it's cleaner code anyway.

But for languages like Java, C++, C#, you probably want a full fledged IDE, and these are extremely popular languages. I can't code java without code completion, but then again I'm not a professional java dev.

It's all personal of course. The only thing that matters is what makes you more efficient. As a Python dev, I've never felt faster using anything but vim. With a statically typed language other than C, I'd feel uncomfortable without a professional IDE. If you're not getting hints that you're calling a function with the wrong types in your IDE, you're missing part of the beauty of writing code in a statically typed language.

But of course, I'm sure there's a vim plugin for that."

I mostly don't use Notepad++ to program (I have the awful ABAP Workbench and sometimes Visual Studio for that). 

One example of something that I like about Notepad++, which Sublime doesn't have: Saving text files as admin. If you try to save the hosts file with sublime, you just get an error message. If you do the same thing in Notepad++ and have the save as admin plugin, you can just click yes on the UAC window and it works.

I also like the Compare plugin and XML Tools. "
15,,1429106019.0,5.0,"I first noticed it when they sent your dash search results to their own servers by default (and then to Amazon). Many people felt this was an invasion of privacy (which it was).

Currently, I'm not 100% sure. There's still the Amazon thing, also some people don't like that Ubuntu is trying to distance itself from Linux in a way (a lot of their updates are designed only for Ubuntu instead of being tools that run on Linux in general)--I think that's fine, but some people disagree. And of course there's just the general elitist that look down on Ubuntu as Nooby distro and the hipsters who look down on it because it ""sold out"".

So 60% of the ~0.00082% that actually answered the survey who use linux also use Ubuntu. It says in the opening the report is biased. Maybe Ubuntu is over represented because Ubuntu users are more likely to answer surveys.

I used Sublime Text, it's neat but well I vim sort of provides the things I need right now. When it doesn't I just use PyCharm.
