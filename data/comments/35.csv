I will automatically mark this post as in progress so that only one person is working on a post at any given time. **Please check that the post does not break the parent sub’s rules before claiming.**


When you're done, please comment again with `done`. Your flair will be updated to reflect the number of posts you've transcribed and the post will be marked as completed.

Here's [a checklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/checklist) that might help you out!

Post type: image. Please use the following formatting:

---

**Note**: Use one of these format guides by copying and pasting everything in the blue markdown box and replacing the prompts with the relevant information. **If you are using New Reddit, please switch your comment editor to Markdown Mode, not Fancy Pants Mode.**

**Remember**: We want to transcribe the text exactly as seen, so please do not make corrections to typos or grammatical errors. Copy emojis into your transcription by finding the proper character in emojipedia.
