32,Lord_Trollingham,1554839768.0,3.0,The issue is that he attracted millions in investment and then sold the company for a huge profit. All based on bullshit and media hype.
33,,1554837442.0,6.0,"It's just as easy to argue he used the money from Paypal to fund the rest. Technologically speaking, the only significant contribution was re-usable rockets which halved launch costs; but it turned out Amazon's Blue Origin had already been working on it. Self driving car efforts were started by Google, etc. He's a great hype man, but you're not getting into space for less than a million dollars just by reusing existing rocket technology. This is why Nasa having a budget is important, they can investigate the feasibility of warp drives and space elevators without needing to be profitable."
34,Lord_Trollingham,1554836596.0,-3.0,"All of these companies took existing ideas and tech and blew them up and made them successful primarily by pulling in billions of dollars of investment. SpaceX is a perfect example. VTOL single-stage rockets with re-usable boosters had been around beforehand. He took the concept, put in insane amounts of money and even more outside investment, created an insanely uncritical media-frenzy and sold the idea to the public in a way that hadn't been achieved before. SpaceX is possibly his only truly great technical achievement because you can't actually make spaceflights based on hype and promises.

&#x200B;

The problem with Elon Musk is that he doesn't only do that with practical and useful technologies, he uses it to peddle impractical fantasy tech too and takes credit for the ideas that people way before him came up with. And people lap it up without any critical thinking. Take the Hyper Loop. Take his ridiculous cold thrusters on Teslas idea. Take his utterly moronic re-invention of the subway just less practical. He consistently over-claims what is possible, downplays obvious issues and plays with the numbers. He creates an insane amount of hype for concepts that are inherently flawed, impossible or outright dangerous. This is why I call him snake oil salesman. He doesn't sell finished ideas, he sells hype and promises."

41,lioncat55,1554840915.0,1.0,"What Hyperloop company did he sell? I remember him releasing the idea and having a competition or two, but I don't remember him starting a company around it."
42,Lord_Trollingham,1554838827.0,1.0,"Exactly. The Mcdonnell Douglas DC-X is basically the first true proof of concept rocket. Unfortunately it was axed in the slew of massive cuts in defence and space funding and other (questionable) priorities within NASA. It was only a matter of time for someone (be it government or private) to fund and develop a re-usable space-faring VTOL rocket. A lot of the know-how was already there and it SpaceX wasn't revolutionary but evolutionary. What is revolutionary is Musks ability to sell ideas, which he uses with far too little restraint in my book."

45,Lord_Trollingham,1554839648.0,3.0,"Putting aside all inherent technical difficulties of creating and maintaining a vacuum chamber thousands of times bigger in volume than the biggest one today, If you cannot grasp the outright impossibility of making hundreds of miles of large diameter vacuum tubing with people-filled vehicles travelling at hundreds of kilometres per hour approach anything near the safety level of manned space-flight, let alone air-travel then I cannot help you. Vacuums are \*extremely\* dangerous.

&#x200B;

If you cannot grasp how sticking cold thrusters ejecting gas at hundreds of bars of pressure and tanks for said thrusters on a civilian car is inherently dangerous and impractical then I cannot help you. If you cannot grasp the sheer stupidity of taking the concept of a subway and making it infinitely less efficient and costly by splitting it up into dozens of small tubes and allowing individual cars in it then I cannot help you."
46,,1554839657.0,2.0,"He can't accomplish it either, he takes credit for thousands of engineers that he treats like disposable garbage. If it weren't for the first reusable rocket failing to deploy one of it's legs when developed at Nasa, the technology would have existed long ago. Unfortunately some engineer screwed up and they scrapped the project to use the budget on other things. He is a hype man, the people that actually accomplish things are engineers. We could be funding them through Nasa and such, but rich people like Musk don't like paying taxes and use this stuff to say they shouldn't have to.

&#x200B;

Edit: Lots of people could accompish the same things if they were bankrolled by their PayPal shares."
47,Lord_Trollingham,1554839966.0,1.0,"Honestly, you can't criticise Musk too much for SpaceX. A lot of the credit issue comes down to the media giving him credit for everything he touches, even if they're 200 year old fantasy concepts like the hyperloop.

&#x200B;

Reserve that criticism for his obvious snake-oil bullshit."
48,iop90,1554840092.0,1.0,"Here’s an example: Steve Jobs was the Hype man for Wozniak’s genius, and later the ingenuity of Apple’s engineering dept. Does that make him less important than those people? To the contrary, he’s seen as the most important person in shaping what Apple has become.

Is it fair to those that have done incredible work with minimal recognition? No. But that’s not the point. Leaders bring the right people together under one vision. They don’t know how the cogs fit together, they just care about the whole machine. That allows them to orchestrate the creation of some of humanity’s most amazing achievements and products. Don’t underestimate the importance of leadership. And more importantly, don’t throw out the baby that is a leader’s accomplishments and the accomplishments of their companies with the bath water that is their personal shortcomings."
