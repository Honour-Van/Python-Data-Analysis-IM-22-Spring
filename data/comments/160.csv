0,memevidente,1627964402.0,31.0,"This survey is always silly (in a good way), but data is data, so here's some trivia:

- Clojure, Elixir, and Julia account for less than 2% of responses each. Small but passionate communities.

- The improvement Julia has had is evident.
  * 2018: 52.8% (months before Julia 1.0) 
  * 2019: No data
  * 2020: 62.2%
  * 2021: 70.69% (nice)

- The number of people who ""love"" Julia went from 323 in 2020 to 755 in 2021.

- Julia is the _second_ youngest language of all the languages listed. Only Crystal (which released it's 1.0 this year) is younger.

- Seeing matlab near the bottom of the list made my day 😌"
